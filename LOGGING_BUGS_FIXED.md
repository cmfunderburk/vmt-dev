# Logging System Bugs - Found and Fixed

## Issues Discovered During Testing

### 1. Missing `log_iteration` Method ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `TelemetryManager` class was missing the `log_iteration()` method that the trading system's `find_compensating_block()` function expected.

**Error**:
```
AttributeError: 'TelemetryManager' object has no attribute 'log_iteration'
```

**Root Cause**: The new `TelemetryManager` had `log_trade_attempt()` but the matching system was calling `log_iteration()` (the old method name from `TradeAttemptLogger`).

**Fix**: Added `log_iteration()` as an alias method that calls `log_trade_attempt()` for backward compatibility.

**File**: `telemetry/db_loggers.py`

### 2. Snapshot Frequency Bug (0 = Log Everything) ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When `agent_snapshot_frequency` or `resource_snapshot_frequency` was set to 0 (intended to disable logging), it actually logged at EVERY tick instead of disabling.

**Symptoms**:
- SUMMARY level (which sets frequency=0) was LARGER than STANDARD level
- SUMMARY: 9.26 MB vs STANDARD: 5.88 MB (should be opposite!)

**Root Cause**: The frequency check logic was:
```python
if self.config.agent_snapshot_frequency > 0:
    if tick % self.config.agent_snapshot_frequency != 0:
        return
```

When frequency=0, the outer `if` was false, so the return was skipped, logging everything.

**Fix**: Changed to explicitly check for 0 first:
```python
if self.config.agent_snapshot_frequency == 0:
    return  # Disabled
if tick % self.config.agent_snapshot_frequency != 0:
    return  # Not the right tick
```

**Result**:
- SUMMARY: 0.09 MB (correct - 99.99% smaller than CSV!)
- STANDARD: 5.88 MB (correct - 99.1% smaller than CSV)

**Files**: `telemetry/db_loggers.py` (both `log_agent_snapshots` and `log_resource_snapshots`)

### 3. NumPy Integer Storage as Bytes ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Position coordinates and inventory values (numpy integers) were being stored as binary blobs in SQLite instead of proper integers.

**Error**:
```
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to bytes.__format__
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: b'\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
```

**Root Cause**: When agents are created, positions come from `np.random.integers()` which returns numpy int64 objects. SQLite was serializing these as binary data instead of converting to integers.

**Fix**: Explicitly convert numpy types to Python types before insertion:
```python
int(agent.pos[0]), int(agent.pos[1]),  # Convert numpy int to Python int
int(agent.inventory.A), int(agent.inventory.B), 
float(utility_val),
float(agent.quotes.ask_A_in_B), 
# ... etc
```

**Files**: `telemetry/db_loggers.py` (`log_agent_snapshots` and `log_resource_snapshots`)

## Testing Results

### All Tests Pass ✅

```bash
python example_new_logging.py  # All 7 examples work
```

### Performance Confirmed ✅

Test: 500 ticks, 50 agents

| Format | Size | vs CSV |
|--------|------|--------|
| Legacy CSV | 644 MB | 100% |
| New SUMMARY | 0.09 MB | 0.01% |
| New STANDARD | 5.88 MB | 0.9% |
| New DEBUG | 593 MB | 92% |

Space savings:
- SUMMARY: 99.99% smaller
- STANDARD: 99.1% smaller
- DEBUG: 7.9% smaller (but with proper database structure + indexing)

### Database Queries Work ✅

```python
# All query types tested and working:
- get_runs()
- get_agent_trajectory()
- get_trades_by_agent()
- get_trade_statistics()
- get_all_agents_at_tick()
# etc.
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always test integration** - I claimed completion before testing with the actual simulation system
2. **Test edge cases** - frequency=0 should have been tested explicitly
3. **Watch for numpy types** - NumPy integers aren't Python integers and need explicit conversion
4. **Verify all code paths** - Should have tested all three log levels independently before claiming done

---

## Current Status

✅ All bugs fixed
✅ All log levels working correctly  
✅ Database queries functional
✅ NumPy type conversion handled
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ Performance targets achieved
✅ Example scripts working

The logging system is now **fully functional and tested**.
