# VMT V1 Checkpoint Review
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Test Coverage:** 45/45 passing

## Executive Summary

This checkpoint represents a major milestone in VMT development. Starting from `Log_system_problems.md`, which identified fundamental gaps in the logging system and trade execution failures, we implemented five major systems that transformed the simulation from non-functional to production-ready.

**Key Achievement:** Agents with complementary inventories now trade successfully, forage sustainably, and exhibit dynamic, realistic behavior.

## Major Systems Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Telemetry System
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation:** `TELEMETRY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**What Was Built:**
- `DecisionLogger` - Logs partner selection and movement decisions every tick
- `TradeAttemptLogger` - Captures all trade attempts with detailed diagnostics
- Enhanced `AgentSnapshotLogger` - Logs every tick (not every 10) with complete quote data
- Extended `Quote` dataclass to include `p_min`/`p_max` reservation bounds

**Why:**
The original logging only captured successful trades, making it impossible to diagnose why trades weren't occurring. The enhanced system provides complete observability into:
- What quotes agents generate
- Which partners they choose and why
- Exactly why each trade attempt fails
- Movement and foraging decisions

**Key Design Decision:**
Log **every event**, not just successes. This verbose logging enabled all subsequent fixes by revealing the actual problems.

**Deviations from Original Plans:**
- Original plans didn't specify the exact structure of enhanced logs
- We added more granular logging than initially envisioned (e.g., every price candidate tried in price search)

---

### 2. Price Search Algorithm
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation:** `PRICE_SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**What Was Built:**
- `generate_price_candidates()` - Generates smart price samples in [ask, bid] range
- Modified `find_compensating_block()` - Iterates over (dA, price) combinations
- Returns `(dA, dB, actual_price)` tuple instead of just `(dA, dB)`

**Why:**
The original midpoint pricing algorithm (`price = (ask + bid) / 2`) failed for CES utilities with complementarity. The midpoint price, combined with integer rounding, often resulted in one agent losing utility even when MRS indicated trade should be possible.

**The Core Problem:**
```
Midpoint price: 1.59
Rounds to dB=2
Buyer utility: 1.37 → 1.37 (loses 0.006!)

But price=1.0 rounds to dB=1
Both agents: 1.37 → 1.47 (gain 0.096!)
```

**Solution:**
Search multiple candidate prices within [ask, bid] range, targeting prices that give specific integer dB values. Early exit on first success.

**Key Design Decision:**
Rather than implementing sophisticated Nash bargaining or utility-based pricing, we use a simple search strategy that tries multiple discrete prices. This is:
- Computationally efficient (early exit)
- Pedagogically clear (observable in logs)
- Sufficient for current needs

**Deviations from Original Plans:**
- Original `algorithmic_planning.md` assumed midpoint pricing would work
- We discovered through telemetry that this assumption was incorrect for CES utilities
- Price search was not in original plans but became necessary

---

### 3. One Trade Per Tick
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation:** `ONE_TRADE_PER_TICK.md`

**What Was Built:**
- Removed `while True` loop from `trade_pair()`
- Deferred quote refresh to housekeeping phase
- Agents trade once per tick, quotes recalculate, trade again next tick if surplus remains

**Why:**
The original implementation allowed multiple trades between the same pair in a single tick, with immediate quote recalculation. This was:
- Pedagogically unclear (unclear when "negotiation rounds" occur)
- Not aligned with user's vision of discrete time steps
- Made it harder to observe convergence

**Key Design Decision:**
One trade per tick creates clear negotiation rounds and allows observation of:
- Gradual convergence to equilibrium
- Step-by-step utility improvements
- Natural unpairing when surplus exhausted

**Deviations from Original Plans:**
- Original plans implied multi-block trading in single tick
- User clarified desired behavior: one trade, recalculate, repeat next tick
- This aligns better with pedagogical goals

---

### 4. Resource Regeneration System  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (with fix)  
**Documentation:** `RESOURCE_REGENERATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `REGENERATION_COOLDOWN_FIX.md`

**What Was Built (Initial):**
- `resource_growth_rate` - Units that regenerate per tick (default: 0)
- `resource_max_amount` - Global maximum cap (default: 5)
- `resource_regen_cooldown` - Ticks to wait after depletion (default: 5)
- `original_amount` tracking per cell
- `regenerate_resources()` function

**Critical Fix Applied:**
Initial implementation only triggered cooldown on **full depletion to 0**, causing cooldown to work only once. 

**Fixed Implementation:**
- Changed from `depleted_at_tick` to `last_harvested_tick`
- **ANY harvest** (even partial) now resets cooldown timer
- Cooldown applies indefinitely, every time a cell is harvested
- Resources regenerate to `original_amount` (per-cell), not global max

**Regeneration Lifecycle:**
```
Cell starts: 5 units
Agent harvests: 5→4 (last_harvested=tick N)
Wait 5 ticks with no harvests
Regenerate: 4→5
Agent harvests again: 5→4 (last_harvested resets)
Wait 5 ticks again
... continues indefinitely
```

**Key Design Decision:**
User specified: "Resources should not respawn for at least 5 turns **after an agent has collected resources from that cell**" - emphasis on ANY collection, not just depletion.

**Deviations from Original Plans:**
- Original plans didn't include resource regeneration at all
- This was added to support sustainable foraging scenarios
- Harvest-based cooldown was refined after initial depletion-based implementation failed

---

### 5. Trade Cooldown System
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation:** `TRADE_COOLDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**What Was Built:**
- `trade_cooldowns: dict[int, int]` in Agent (partner_id → cooldown_until_tick)
- `trade_cooldown_ticks` parameter (default: 5)
- Cooldown set after failed trade in `trade_pair()`
- Cooldown filtering in `choose_partner()`

**Why:**
Agents were detecting small MRS-based surplus (e.g., 0.26), choosing each other as partners, but all discrete trades failed. They remained locked targeting each other for many ticks instead of foraging.

**Example Problem (seed=45, ticks 3-9):**
- Agents detect surplus=0.26
- 54 trade attempts, all fail
- Stuck in loop for 7 ticks
- Should forage instead

**Solution:**
After a failed trade attempt, both agents enter 5-tick cooldown where they cannot target that partner. During cooldown, they forage or seek other partners.

**Key Design Decision:**
Chose post-trade cooldown (Option 5) over:
- Minimum surplus threshold (too arbitrary)
- Pre-checking trade feasibility (doubles computation)
- Other alternatives

Cooldown is:
- Simple to understand
- Adaptive (can retry later)
- Mutual (both agents affected)
- Configurable

**Deviations from Original Plans:**
- Trade cooldown was not in original plans
- Emerged as necessary solution to MRS/discrete utility mismatch
- User selected from 5 proposed options

---

## Configuration Centralization

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Documentation:** `CONFIGURATION.md`

**What Was Done:**
- Centralized all defaults in `scenarios/schema.py` (`ScenarioParams`)
- Removed explicit spread values from scenario files (use default 0.0)
- Added comprehensive documentation of all parameters

**Key Decision:**
`spread = 0.0` as default (true reservation prices) is crucial for:
- CES utility trading to work
- Zero-inventory compatibility
- Diagnostic clarity

**All New Parameters:**
```python
# Trading
spread: float = 0.0
trade_cooldown_ticks: int = 5

# Resources
resource_growth_rate: int = 0
resource_max_amount: int = 5
resource_regen_cooldown: int = 5

# (plus all existing parameters)
```

## Scenario Modifications

### `three_agent_barter.yaml`
**Changes:**
- Bootstrap inventories: `[5,0,3]` → `[8,4,6]` for A, `[0,5,3]` → `[4,8,6]` for B
- Removed explicit `spread` (uses default 0.0)
- Added resource regeneration parameters
- Added trade cooldown parameter

**Why:**
- Original `[5,0,3]` and `[0,5,3]` caused zero-inventory price explosion
- Bootstrap with non-zero values prevents extreme prices
- More balanced inventories allow mutually beneficial trades

### `single_agent_forage.yaml`
**Changes:**
- Removed explicit `spread` (uses default 0.0)
- Added resource regeneration parameters for sustainable foraging

---

## Critical Discoveries & Fixes

### Discovery 1: Zero-Inventory Price Explosion
**Found via:** Enhanced telemetry  
**Root Cause:** CES utility with B=0 or A=0 produces infinite/extreme MRS values  
**Solution:** Bootstrap inventories to non-zero values

### Discovery 2: Midpoint Pricing Failure
**Found via:** Manual testing with 1-for-1 exchange hypothesis  
**Root Cause:** Midpoint price + integer rounding doesn't guarantee mutual improvement with CES complements  
**Solution:** Price search algorithm

### Discovery 3: Partner Lock-in Loop
**Found via:** Visual testing with seed=45  
**Root Cause:** Small MRS surplus doesn't translate to feasible discrete trades  
**Solution:** Trade cooldown system

### Discovery 4: Foraging Over-Movement
**Found via:** Visual testing  
**Root Cause:** Utility calculation used full cell amount, not forage_rate  
**Solution:** Changed to use `min(cell.amount, forage_rate)` in utility calculations

### Discovery 5: One-Time Regeneration Bug
**Found via:** Visual testing  
**Root Cause:** Cooldown only tracked full depletion, cleared after regeneration  
**Solution:** Changed to harvest-based tracking (last_harvested_tick)

---

## Design Philosophy Evolution

### Original Assumptions (from planning docs)
1. Midpoint pricing would work for all utility functions
2. Multi-block trading in single tick
3. Resource regeneration not considered
4. Simple MRS-based partner selection would work

### Actual Implementation Learnings
1. **Price search necessary** - Midpoint fails with CES complementarity + integer constraints
2. **One trade per tick** - Clearer pedagogy, observable convergence
3. **Resource regeneration critical** - Needed for sustainable scenarios
4. **Cooldown mechanisms essential** - Both for trades and resources, prevents pathological loops

### Key Insight
**MRS-based pricing identifies potential for trade (continuous), but discrete trades require additional mechanisms (price search, cooldowns) to function correctly.**

## Algorithmic Changes from Original Plans

### Trading Algorithm

**Original Plan (Planning-FINAL.md):**
```
1. Calculate MRS for both agents
2. Check overlap: bid > ask
3. Use midpoint price
4. Try trade sizes with this price
5. Execute if both improve
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```
1. Calculate MRS for both agents
2. Check overlap: bid > ask
3. For each trade size:
   a. Generate price candidates in [ask, bid]
   b. Try each price
   c. Return first that improves both
4. Execute ONE trade per tick
5. Recalculate quotes in housekeeping
6. If trade fails: set 5-tick cooldown
```

**Why Different:**
- Midpoint alone insufficient for CES utilities
- Integer rounding creates discrete effects
- One trade per tick clearer pedagogically
- Cooldown prevents pathological loops

### Resource System

**Original Plan:**
- Static resources (no regeneration mentioned)

**Actual Implementation:**
- Configurable regeneration with harvest-based cooldown
- Resources regenerate to original seed amount
- 5-tick cooldown after ANY harvest

**Why Added:**
- Needed for sustainable foraging scenarios
- Prevents resource exhaustion deadlock
- Creates strategic spatial dynamics

### Foraging Behavior

**Original Plan:**
- Distance-discounted utility seeking
- Formula: `ΔU * β^distance`

**Actual Implementation:**
- Same formula BUT uses `forage_rate` (1 unit), not full cell amount
- Agent evaluates all cells including current position
- Current cell has distance=0, giving natural staying advantage

**Why Different:**
- Original used full cell amount in utility calculation
- Created incorrect incentives (overvalued distant large cells)
- Fixed to use actual harvestable amount (forage_rate)

---

## Economic Model Refinements

### CES Utility Challenges

**Discovered:**
CES utilities with `rho < 0` (complementarity) create challenges:
1. Zero inventory → infinite/extreme prices
2. Imbalanced inventories → MRS gaps don't guarantee discrete trade feasibility
3. Small MRS-based surplus ≠ actual utility improvement from integer trades

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Bootstrap:** Start with non-zero, somewhat balanced inventories
2. **Price search:** Find prices that work with integer rounding
3. **Trade cooldown:** Avoid futile attempts when discrete trades impossible

**Economic Insight:**
MRS is a **marginal** (infinitesimal) concept. Discrete integer trades require additional mechanisms beyond simple MRS comparison.

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Approach
- Test-driven development for new systems
- Maintain all existing tests (no regressions)
- Add comprehensive coverage for edge cases
- Integration testing with multiple seeds

### Current Coverage
- **Core state:** 5 tests
- **M1 integration:** 3 tests  
- **Utilities:** 12 tests
- **Reservations:** 5 tests
- **Scenarios:** 3 tests
- **Simulation:** 4 tests
- **Regeneration:** 8 tests (new)
- **Trade cooldown:** 4 tests (new)
- **Trade rounding:** 2 tests

**Total: 45 passing, 1 skipped**

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Bootstrap Dependency:** CES trading requires non-zero, somewhat balanced initial inventories
2. **Price Search Scope:** Tries up to ~20 price candidates; could miss optimal price in edge cases
3. **Trade Cooldown:** Fixed 5-tick duration; could be adaptive based on failure count
4. **Regeneration:** Only for initially seeded cells; can't spawn new resources yet (Option 3)

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

From discussion but deferred:

1. **Random New Resources (Option 3):**
   - Spawn resources in empty cells
   - `resource_spawn_rate` parameter
   - More dynamic environments

2. **Adaptive Cooldowns:**
   - Longer cooldown after repeated failures
   - Partner memory (blacklist)
   - Surplus-based cooldown duration

3. **More Sophisticated Pricing:**
   - Nash bargaining solution
   - Utility-based price calculation
   - Learning successful price ranges

4. **Fractional Trades:**
   - Discussed but rejected for pedagogical clarity
   - Integer good-for-good trades maintained

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintained
✅ All original tests pass  
✅ Existing scenarios work (regeneration defaults to disabled)  
✅ No breaking API changes  
✅ Default parameters maintain old behavior where applicable  

### New Defaults
- `spread = 0.0` (was 0.05 in some scenarios) - **Intentional change**
- Regeneration disabled by default (backward compatible)
- Trade cooldown enabled by default (improves behavior)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Production)
1. ✅ All systems functional and tested
2. ✅ Documentation complete
3. ✅ Ready for deployment

### Short-term (Refinements)
1. Monitor agent behavior across more seeds
2. Tune cooldown durations based on gameplay testing
3. Consider adding Option 3 (random resource spawning)
4. Add visualization for cooldown states

### Long-term (Research)
1. Investigate more robust MRS-to-discrete-trade mapping
2. Consider Shapley value or other fair division mechanisms
3. Explore learning/adaptation for price discovery
4. Study convergence rates and equilibrium properties

---

## Key Takeaways for Developers

### 1. Trust the Telemetry
Every fix in this session came from **looking at the logs**. The enhanced telemetry was the foundation that made all other improvements possible.

### 2. Test Hypotheses Explicitly
The 1-for-1 exchange test (manually verified) was crucial for understanding the price search problem. Don't assume - verify.

### 3. Discrete vs Continuous Matters
The core challenge throughout was bridging continuous economic theory (MRS, utility functions) with discrete implementation constraints (integer trades, tick-based time).

### 4. Cooldowns Prevent Pathologies
Both resource regeneration and trade cooldowns use the same pattern: prevent immediate re-action to avoid loops. This is a useful design pattern for agent systems.

### 5. Pedagogy Drives Design
Decisions like "one trade per tick" were driven by pedagogical clarity, not just algorithmic efficiency. The simulation is a teaching tool first.
