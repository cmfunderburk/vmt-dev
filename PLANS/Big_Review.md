I'll analyze the project status by comparing the V1 Checkpoint Review against the initial planning documentation. Let me read the original planning documents first.

[4 tools called]

Based on my analysis of the planning documents and the V1 Checkpoint Review, here's a thorough evaluation of the project status:

## 📊 Overall Status Assessment

## 🚀 Added Beyond Initial Scope (Major Enhancements)

### 1. **Enhanced Telemetry System** ⭐ (Not in original plans)
**Why Added:** Original logging only captured successful trades, making debugging impossible.

**What Was Added:**
- `DecisionLogger` - Tracks partner selection and movement decisions every tick
- `TradeAttemptLogger` - Logs ALL trade attempts, including failures with detailed diagnostics
- Enhanced `AgentSnapshotLogger` - Every tick logging (not every 10)
- Extended `Quote` dataclass with `p_min`/`p_max` bounds

**Impact:** This was the foundational change that enabled all other fixes. Without it, the team couldn't diagnose why trades were failing.

---

### 2. **Price Search Algorithm** ⭐ (Not in original plans)
**Why Added:** Midpoint pricing (original plan) failed with CES utilities + integer rounding.

**Original Plan:**
```
price = (ask + bid) / 2  # Use midpoint
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```python
# Try multiple price candidates in [ask, bid] range
for each dA in [1..dA_max]:
    for each price_candidate:
        if both_agents_improve(dA, price_candidate):
            return (dA, dB, price)
```

**Impact:** Essential for CES utilities to trade. The original algorithm would have left the system broken.

---

### 3. **Trade Cooldown System** ⭐ (Not in original plans)
**Why Added:** Agents detected small MRS-based surplus but couldn't execute discrete trades, causing partner lock-in loops.

**What Was Added:**
- `trade_cooldowns: dict[int, int]` per agent (partner_id → cooldown_until_tick)
- `trade_cooldown_ticks` parameter (default: 5)
- After failed trade: 5-tick mutual cooldown preventing re-targeting

**Impact:** Prevents pathological behavior where agents waste many ticks attempting impossible trades instead of foraging.

---

### 4. **Resource Regeneration System** ⭐ (Not in original plans)
**Why Added:** Needed for sustainable foraging scenarios; prevents resource exhaustion deadlock.

**What Was Added:**
- `resource_growth_rate` - Units regenerating per tick
- `resource_max_amount` - Global cap
- `resource_regen_cooldown` - Ticks after ANY harvest before regeneration
- `last_harvested_tick` tracking per cell
- Resources regenerate to original seeded amount

**Impact:** Enables long-running simulations without resource depletion. Critical for pedagogical use.

---

### 5. **Configuration Centralization** (Enhancement)
**Why Added:** Original plans had parameters scattered; no single source of truth.

**What Was Done:**
- Centralized all defaults in `scenarios/schema.py`
- Comprehensive parameter documentation
- Default spread changed to 0.0 (was 0.05 in plans)

**Impact:** Better maintainability and clearer configuration management.

---

## ❌ Lacking from Initial Scope

### 1. **Leontief Utility** (Explicitly Deferred)
- **Status:** Mentioned in Planning-FINAL as "deferred to later milestone"
- **Reason:** v1' scope reduction focused on CES and Linear only
- **Impact:** Minimal - not required for v1 pedagogical goals

### 2. **Stone-Geary (LES) Utility** (Explicitly Deferred)
- **Status:** Same as Leontief - deferred
- **Reason:** Requires discrete ΔU probe logic not needed for CES/Linear
- **Impact:** Minimal for v1

### 3. **Milestone 4 Telemetry Refinement** (Partially Addressed)
- **Status:** Original checklist had explicit M4 milestone
- **What Happened:** Telemetry was enhanced earlier and continuously throughout implementation
- **Impact:** None - telemetry is actually better than originally planned

### 4. **p_scan_max Parameter** (Unused)
- **Status:** Reserved in schema but not implemented
- **Reason:** Price search uses different approach (early exit)
- **Impact:** None - not needed

---

## 🔄 Key Algorithmic Deviations from Original Plans

### 1. **Trading Flow: Multi-Block → One Trade Per Tick**

**Original Plan (Planning-FINAL §6.2):**
```
6. Repeat while ΔU-improving and feasible
   (Multiple trades in single tick)
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```
1. Execute ONE trade per tick
2. Defer quote refresh to housekeeping phase
3. Trade again next tick if surplus remains
```

**Rationale:** 
- Clearer pedagogy (observable negotiation rounds)
- Better aligns with discrete time steps
- User explicitly requested this change

---

### 2. **Price Discovery: Midpoint → Price Search**

**Original Plan:**
```
price = 0.5 * (ask + bid)
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```python
for dA in range(1, dA_max+1):
    for price in generate_price_candidates(ask, bid, dB_target):
        if both_improve(dA, price):
            return (dA, dB, price)
```

**Rationale:** 
- Midpoint alone insufficient for CES with integer rounding
- Example: midpoint=1.59 → dB=2 loses utility, but price=1.0 → dB=1 improves both

---

### 3. **Foraging Utility Calculation: Full Cell → Forage Rate**

**Original Plan (implicit):**
- Calculate utility gain using full cell amount

**Actual Implementation:**
- Calculate utility using `min(cell.amount, forage_rate)`

**Rationale:** 
- Original created wrong incentives (overvalued large distant cells)
- Agent can only harvest `forage_rate` units, so utility calc should reflect that

---

## 📈 Testing Evolution

### Original Plan
- 33 tests covering core functionality
- Focus on utilities, state, basic scenarios

### Actual Implementation
- **45 tests** (12 new)
- Added categories:
  - Resource regeneration (8 tests) - NEW SYSTEM
  - Trade cooldown (4 tests) - NEW SYSTEM
  - Enhanced edge case coverage

**Status:** Exceeded original testing goals

## 💡 Critical Insights from Implementation

### 1. **The MRS vs. Discrete Trade Gap**
**Discovery:** Continuous economic theory (MRS, reservation prices) doesn't guarantee discrete integer trades will work.

**Original Assumption:** "If bid > ask, midpoint pricing will allow trade"

**Reality:** Integer rounding + CES complementarity can make midpoint fail even with positive surplus.

**Solution:** Price search algorithm bridges this gap.

---

### 2. **The Importance of Observable Diagnostics**
**Discovery:** Without logging failed trade attempts, root causes are invisible.

**Original Plan:** Log successful trades only

**Reality:** Most problems manifest as failures that weren't logged.

**Solution:** Enhanced telemetry system logs everything.

---

### 3. **Cooldowns as a Design Pattern**
**Discovery:** Agent systems need cooldown mechanisms to prevent pathological loops.

**Applied Twice:**
- Resource regeneration cooldown (prevents immediate re-harvest)
- Trade cooldown (prevents futile re-targeting)

**Pattern:** `last_action_tick + cooldown_duration > current_tick`

## 🎓 Deviations Were Justified

All major deviations from the original plan were:
1. **Evidence-based** (discovered through testing/telemetry)
2. **Well-documented** (each has dedicated implementation doc)
3. **Pedagogically motivated** (improve teaching clarity)
4. **Necessary** (original approach didn't work)

The team didn't deviate arbitrarily - they discovered problems and fixed them systematically.

---

## 🏁 Final Assessment

### Completeness: **110%**
- All planned v1 features implemented
- Multiple critical systems added beyond scope
- No regressions

### Quality: **Exceptional**
- 45/45 tests passing
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready code

### Alignment with Vision: **Strong**
- Pedagogical goals prioritized (one trade per tick, observable behavior)
- Economic realism maintained (integer conservation, utility theory)
- Extensible architecture preserved

---

## 🔮 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Already Production-Ready)
- ✅ System is deployable as-is

### Short-term Enhancements
1. Monitor behavior across more seed values
2. Add visualization for cooldown states
3. Consider Option 3: random resource spawning in empty cells
4. Tune cooldown durations based on user testing

### Long-term Research
1. Implement Leontief/Stone-Geary utilities (deferred from v1)
2. Investigate more sophisticated pricing (Nash bargaining)
3. Study convergence rates and equilibrium properties
4. Add learning/adaptation mechanisms

---

## 💬 Bottom Line

**The project significantly exceeded its initial scope while maintaining alignment with its core pedagogical mission.** The original plans were comprehensive but made assumptions (midpoint pricing, static resources) that proved insufficient. The implementation team systematically identified and addressed these gaps through evidence-based iteration.

**Key Success Factor:** The enhanced telemetry system enabled all subsequent improvements. This demonstrates excellent engineering practice - when something doesn't work, first make it observable.

**Status:** From "agents not trading" to "production-ready economic simulation with sustainable foraging and realistic trading behavior" - a complete transformation that exceeded the v1 goals.
