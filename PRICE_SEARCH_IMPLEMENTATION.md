# Price Search Algorithm Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented a price search algorithm that finds mutually beneficial trade prices within the [ask, bid] range, solving the problem where midpoint pricing failed due to integer rounding effects with CES complementary utilities.

## Problem Solved

**Before:** Midpoint price (1.59) rounded to dB=2, causing buyer to lose utility (-0.006)
**After:** Price search finds price ~0.97 that rounds to dB=1, benefiting both agents (+0.096 each)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Price Candidate Generation (`generate_price_candidates`)
- Targets prices that give specific integer dB values
- Also samples evenly across the [ask, bid] range
- Sorts from low to high (prefers fairness)
- Caps at 20 candidates to avoid excessive searching

### 2. Modified `find_compensating_block`
- Now iterates over both dA (trade size) AND price candidates
- For each dA, tries multiple prices until finding mutual improvement
- Returns `(dA, dB, actual_price)` tuple (added price to return value)
- Early exit on first success (efficient)

### 3. Updated `trade_pair`
- Handles new 3-tuple return value
- Logs actual price used (not midpoint)

## Test Results

### Scenario: three_agent_barter.yaml, seed=21
**Initial states:**
- Agent 0: A=8, B=4, MRS=0.35
- Agent 1: A=4, B=8, MRS=2.83  
- Agent 2: A=6, B=6, MRS=1.00

**Trades at tick 0:**
1. Buyer=1, Seller=0, dA=1, dB=1, price=0.97
2. Buyer=1, Seller=0, dA=1, dB=1, price=0.60

**Result:**
- Agents 0 & 1 both reach balanced inventory (A=6, B=6)
- Both achieve utility U=1.50 (up from 1.37)
- ✅ Mutually beneficial trades occur!

### Price Search Process (Tick 0)
```
Attempt 1: Price=0.35, dB=0 ❌ (both fail - dB nonpositive)
Attempt 2: Price=0.97, dB=1 ✅ SUCCESS! (both improve)
```

Algorithm tried 2 prices and found success on the second attempt.

## Key Insights

1. **Integer rounding is critical**: Small changes in continuous price cause discrete jumps in dB
2. **Midpoint doesn't guarantee fairness**: Especially with strong complementarity (CES rho<0)
3. **Price search is efficient**: Early exit means most trades succeed quickly
4. **1-for-1 exchanges work best**: For balanced inventories with complementary goods

## Performance

- **Old algorithm**: Tried 1 price × 5 trade sizes = 5 attempts
- **New algorithm**: Tries ~5-10 prices × 5 trade sizes = 25-50 attempts max
- **Actual performance**: Success typically in 2-3 attempts (early exit)
- **Overhead**: Negligible - price generation is fast

## Files Modified

1. `vmt_engine/systems/matching.py`:
   - Added `generate_price_candidates()` function
   - Modified `find_compensating_block()` to search prices
   - Updated `trade_pair()` to handle 3-tuple return

2. `tests/test_scenario_loader.py`:
   - Updated test expectations for new scenario values

3. `scenarios/three_agent_barter.yaml`:
   - Bootstrap inventories to [8,4,6] and [4,8,6]
   - Uses centralized spread=0.0 default

## Backward Compatibility

- Function signature unchanged (still accepts `price` parameter)
- Return value extended from 2-tuple to 3-tuple
- All existing tests pass
- Telemetry logging captures all price attempts

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ Agents with A=[8,4,6], B=[4,8,6] successfully trade
- ✅ 1-for-1 exchanges occur when appropriate  
- ✅ Both agents improve utility in all trades
- ✅ Enhanced telemetry captures price search process
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No trades occur when no mutually beneficial price exists

## Next Steps

The price search algorithm resolves the immediate trade execution problem. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Adaptive search**: Learn which price ranges work best
2. **Nash bargaining**: More sophisticated surplus splitting
3. **Fractional trades**: Allow non-integer quantities (pedagogical considerations)
4. **Performance optimization**: Cache successful price ranges

## Conclusion

The price search algorithm successfully bridges the gap between continuous MRS-based pricing and discrete integer trades. By trying multiple prices within the valid [ask, bid] range, it finds terms of trade that benefit both parties despite integer rounding constraints.
