Random Matching Protocol

Random pairing for null hypothesis baseline. Agents are paired randomly without
regard to potential gains from trade, distance, or preferences.

Economic Properties:
- Zero allocative efficiency (no welfare maximization)
- Useful baseline for comparison with strategic matching
- Demonstrates value of preference-aware pairing

References:
- Random assignment as null hypothesis in market design
- Benchmark for stable matching algorithms (Gale-Shapley)

Version: 2025.10.28 (Phase 2a - Baseline Protocol)
