"""
Random Walk Search Protocol

Pure stochastic exploration for baseline comparison. Agents select random
movement targets within vision radius with no utility calculation.

Economic Properties:
- Zero information efficiency
- Equivalent to Brownian motion in economic search models
- Demonstrates value of information vs rational search

    """
    Stochastic exploration for baseline comparison.
    
    Behavior:
        - Agents select random positions within vision radius
        - No utility calculation or optimization
        - Pure exploration, zero exploitation
        - Honors pairing commitments (paired agents don't search)
    
    Economic Interpretation:
        - Zero-information baseline for measuring search efficiency
        - Shows opportunity cost of not using available information
        - Demonstrates how random search performs in spatial markets
    
    Pedagogical Value:
        - Clear demonstration of information value
        - Simple null hypothesis for search theory
        - Easy to understand and implement
