# VMT Planning-Only Mode for Complex Features

## Critical Rule: No Implementation During Planning Phase

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: When working on market implementation or any complex feature planning, DO NOT make any code changes until explicitly told by the user to start implementation.

## Planning Phase Requirements

During planning discussions:
1. **Focus on conceptual clarity** - Understand the economic/theoretical goals first
2. **Design before coding** - Create comprehensive plans before any implementation
3. **Document decisions** - Write down design choices and rationale
4. **Validate approach** - Confirm understanding with user before proceeding

## When This Rule Applies

This rule is MANDATORY when:
- Implementing market-related features
- Adding new protocols or systems
- Making architectural changes
- Working on complex multi-file features
- Any time the user mentions "planning" or "thinking through"

## Implementation Phase

Only begin implementation when the user explicitly states:
- "Start implementing"
- "Begin coding"
- "Make the changes"
- Or similar clear implementation directives

## Why This Matters

The market implementation project demonstrated the cost of implementing the wrong solution:
- Built a global market information system instead of a protocol-specific solution
- Wasted significant development time on technically correct but functionally wrong approach
- Required complete reimplementation after requirements were clarified

## Enforcement

When in planning mode:
- ❌ DO NOT use: search_replace, write, delete_file, MultiEdit, edit_notebook
- ✅ DO use: read_file, grep, codebase_search, list_dir, web_search
- ✅ DO: Create planning documents, discuss architecture, clarify requirements
- ✅ DO: Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions
