# Telemetry Database Location

The telemetry database is located in the `logs/` directory, not in the project root.

**Primary database location:**
- [logs/telemetry.db](mdc:logs/telemetry.db) - Main telemetry database

**Important notes:**
- Always check `logs/telemetry.db` first when looking for telemetry data
- There may be a `telemetry.db` in the project root, but the active database is in `logs/`
- Use `logs/telemetry.db` for all telemetry queries and analysis
- The database contains tables for runs, decisions, pairings, and other simulation data

**Common telemetry queries:**
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('logs/telemetry.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Query the database...
```

This location is critical for debugging agent behavior, analyzing decision patterns, and understanding simulation outcomes.
