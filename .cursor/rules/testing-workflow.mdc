# Testing Workflow Preferences

## Manual Testing Policy

**DO NOT** automatically run scenario tests after making code changes. The user prefers to validate changes manually.

### When Making Changes

1. ✅ Make the requested code/scenario changes
2. ✅ Explain what was changed and why
3. ✅ Suggest specific test commands if helpful
4. ❌ DO NOT run `python3 scripts/run_headless.py ...` automatically
5. ❌ DO NOT run pytest automatically unless explicitly requested

### Example Response Pattern

```
I've updated the scenario to set dA_max: 10. This should allow agents 
to find viable trades with larger quantities.

You can test this with:
  python3 scripts/run_headless.py scenarios/demos/demo_02_barter_vs_money.yaml --seed 42 --max-ticks 40

Then check if trades are occurring around tick 30.
```

### Exception

If the user explicitly says:
- "run the tests"
- "test this"
- "verify this works"
- "execute scenario X"

Then it's okay to run tests.

## Database Management

If accumulated telemetry data becomes problematic, suggest:
```bash
rm logs/telemetry.db  # User will do this themselves
```

Don't delete files automatically unless explicitly requested.
