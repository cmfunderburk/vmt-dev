# Money System Pedagogical Guidelines

## Teaching Objectives
- Why money emerges (reduces double coincidence of wants)
- Price discovery (λ convergence; endogenous prices)
- Market thickness and liquidity effects
- Institutional preference for money vs barter
- Temporal (mode schedule) × exchange constraints

## Required Demo Scenarios (specs live in docs)
- Demo 1: Simple monetary exchange — `scenarios/demos/demo_01_simple_money.yaml`
- Demo 2: KKT convergence — `scenarios/demos/demo_02_kkt_convergence.yaml`
- Demo 3: Mixed regime dynamics — `scenarios/demos/demo_03_mixed_regime.yaml`
- Demo 4: Liquidity zones — `scenarios/demos/demo_04_liquidity_zones.yaml`
- Demo 5: Mode schedule × money — `scenarios/demos/demo_05_mode_schedule_money.yaml`

## Visualization Requirements (essentials)
- λ trajectories; price convergence; trade‑type distribution
- Mode timeline; liquidity heat map

## For Instructors (see docs for full materials)
- Quick start, exercises, assessments, and discussion prompts are maintained in:
  - [docs/1_project_overview.md](mdc:docs/1_project_overview.md)
  - [docs/BIG/money_phase*.md](mdc:docs/BIG/money_phase*.md)
  - Log viewer/visualization notes in GUI rules and `src/vmt_log_viewer/`

## Best Practices
- Fixed seeds for reproducibility; keep scenarios small and focused
- Build complexity gradually; pause to explain key events
- Prepare telemetry DB; have visual backups ready
