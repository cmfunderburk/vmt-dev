# Deep Research Prompt: Centralized Market Mechanisms for Agent-Based Economic Simulation

## Context

I'm developing VMT (Visualizing Microeconomic Theory), a spatially-grounded agent-based economic simulation platform. The system currently implements bilateral spot trading where agents physically move toward each other on a 2D grid and negotiate trades when adjacent. 

**Current Architecture:**
- Agents exist on a NxN grid with limited vision radius
- 7-phase tick cycle: Perception → Decision → Movement → Trade → Foraging → Resources → Housekeeping
- Agents use SearchProtocol to find partners, MatchingProtocol to form pairs, and BargainingProtocol to negotiate
- All trades are bilateral with heterogeneous prices
- System is deterministic and research-grade

## Goal

Implement centralized market mechanisms (Walrasian equilibrium, posted prices, continuous double auctions) alongside the existing bilateral system. This is a major architectural addition, moving from decentralized price negotiation to centralized price discovery.

## Critical Challenges

### 1. Spatial Market Location Problem
In bilateral trading, agents meet at physical locations. For centralized markets, we need to determine:
- WHERE do markets exist? (physical locations vs abstract institutions)
- HOW do agents discover and interact with markets?
- WHAT determines market participation? (distance, network effects, discovery costs)

### 2. Market Localization 
How to create truly LOCAL markets that:
- Emerge organically from agent interactions
- Allow regional price differences and arbitrage
- Scale from village markets to global exchanges
- Maintain spatial grounding (not telepathic trading)

### 3. Mechanism Design Questions
- Order submission: Do agents need to be physically present or within range?
- Price discovery: How does tatonnement work in spatial context?
- Information propagation: How do prices spread from markets?
- Market competition: Can multiple markets with different mechanisms coexist?

### 4. Integration Architecture
- How to modify the 7-phase tick to accommodate both bilateral and centralized trades?
- Should markets be a new phase or integrated into existing Trade phase?
- How do agents decide between going to a market vs bilateral trading?
- What new data structures and effects are needed?

## Research Request

Please research and provide:

### A. Theoretical Foundation
1. How do real-world local markets emerge and function spatially?
2. What does economic geography say about market location and catchment areas?
3. How have other ABM platforms (NetLogo, MASON, Repast) handled market mechanisms?
4. What are key papers on spatial market models and local price discovery?

### B. Technical Architecture 
1. Compare approaches: Market Posts (physical locations) vs Market Zones (regions) vs Network Markets (social graphs)
2. Analyze pros/cons of different market discovery mechanisms
3. Suggest parameter schemes for controlling market localization
4. Recommend data structures for order books in spatial context

### C. Implementation Strategy
1. Propose a "Market Post" architecture where markets are physical structures agents discover and approach
2. Design visibility/interaction/broadcast radii system for market influence
3. Outline integration with existing SearchProtocol and movement systems
4. Specify new Effect types needed (TargetMarket, SubmitOrder, MarketClearing)

### D. Economic Properties
1. How to ensure markets achieve efficiency gains over bilateral trading?
2. What conditions lead to price convergence vs persistent arbitrage?
3. How to model market thickness and liquidity spatially?
4. What failure modes to guard against?

### E. Concrete Examples
1. Scenario configuration for a two-market economy with arbitrage
2. Code structure for WalrasianAuctioneer implementation
3. Test cases for verifying economic properties
4. Visualization strategy for market activities

## Constraints

- Must maintain spatial grounding - no telepathic trading
- Must be deterministic for research reproducibility  
- Should integrate cleanly with existing protocol system
- Performance must scale to 100+ agents
- Must support pedagogical use (clear, visualizable)

## Desired Output Format

Please provide:
1. Executive summary of recommended approach
2. Detailed architectural design with diagrams
3. Step-by-step implementation plan (4 weeks, 30 hours)
4. Key economic insights and literature references
5. Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
6. Example code snippets for critical components

## Additional Context

The system is implemented in Python with a protocol-based architecture. We use Effects (commands) to modify state, maintaining strict separation between decision-making and state mutation. The goal is to create a comprehensive microeconomic theory simulator covering everything from primitive barter to modern market mechanisms.

Focus on the "Market Post" approach where markets exist as discoverable locations on the grid with parametric influence radii. This maintains spatial intuition while enabling sophisticated price discovery mechanisms.
