# ARCHIVED: Protocol Phase 1 Planning Documents

**Archived:** 2025-10-28  
**Original Location:** `docs/ssot/`  
**Purpose:** Planning documents for protocol modularization Phase 0-1

---

## Why Archived

These documents served their purpose in planning and guiding the protocol modularization work that was completed on October 26-27, 2025. They have been superseded by:

1. **Strategic Vision:** `docs/BIGGEST_PICTURE/vision_and_architecture.md` (Oct 27)
2. **Current Implementation Plan:** `docs/protocols_10-27/master_implementation_plan.md` (Oct 27)  
3. **Reorientation Guide:** `docs/BIGGEST_PICTURE/CURRENT_STATE_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md` (Oct 28)
4. **Session State:** `docs/ASDF/SESSION_STATE.md` (ongoing)

## What These Documents Were

- **decision_points.md** - Tracked 5 architectural decisions for protocol implementation
- **protocol_modularization_master_plan.md** - Detailed plan for the 4-week minimal implementation
- **testing_validation_strategy.md** - Testing approach for protocol architecture
- **implementation_roadmap.md** - Original prioritization and timeline (replaced by protocols_10-27/)

## Historical Value

These documents show the planning process that led to the successful Phase 1 implementation:
- All 5 architectural decisions were resolved
- Phase 0 (infrastructure) completed in ~2 hours
- Phase 1 (legacy adapters) completed October 26-27
- System refactored with significant LOC reduction
- Foundation prepared for Phase 2+ protocol implementation

## Status at Archive Time

âœ… **Mission Accomplished** - The protocol architecture these documents planned is now implemented and merged to main.
