Here‚Äôs a structured pair of documents to break your paralysis and channel energy effectively. They synthesize the uploaded planning files into a **step-by-step implementation plan** (Document 1) and a **companion checklist** (Document 2). The plan is sequenced to (i) finish v1.1 polish cleanly, then (ii) build the intellectual scaffolding for money and markets before writing a single line of new code. This matches the direction laid out in your theoretical and planning materials.

## üìÑ **Document 1: VMT ‚Äì Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 0: Orientation (Today)**

**Goal:** Eliminate ambiguity, lock in direction, and set up a clean working state.

1. **Repository Hygiene Pass**

   * Ensure `main` is clean, with all experimental branches either merged or shelved.
   * Create a `v1.1-polish` branch to isolate polish work.
   * Tag the current state as `v1.1-prepolish` for easy rollback.

2. **Read-In Session**

   * Re-read `vmt_engine` modules and `systems/` code while taking notes in `docs/engine_notes.md`.
   * Update or create any high-level architectural diagrams (Mermaid in Markdown preferred) to reflect actual code structure.

---

### **Phase 1: v1.1 Polish**

**Goal:** Deliver a stable, documented, reproducible barter-only engine that can serve as the base for future modules.

1. **Engine Overview Documentation**

   * Write `vmt_engine/README.md` covering: the 7-phase tick cycle, determinism guarantees, system responsibilities, and key algorithms.
   * Embed a tick cycle diagram and a short glossary of terms.

2. **Foundational Scenario + Integration Test**

   * Create `scenarios/foundational_barter_demo.yaml` with three agents and complementary endowments.
   * Annotate extensively to function as an executable tutorial.
   * Add `tests/test_foundational_scenario.py` verifying deterministic trade outcomes and conservation laws.

3. **Code Annotation Pass**

   * Focus on `matching.py` (tie-breaking, partner selection), `quotes.py` (reservation logic), `utility.py` (epsilon and MRS), and `simulation.py` (phase ordering rationale).
   * Insert explanatory comments reflecting the theory‚Äìcode bridge.

4. **Cleanup and Style Consistency**

   * Remove or resolve all TODOs and temporary hacks.
   * Run autoformatters and linter.
   * Finalize naming conventions for consistency with future monetary modules.

**Deliverable:** A tagged `v1.1-final` branch with no open polish tasks.

---

### **Phase 2: Theoretical Foundation for Money & Markets**

**Goal:** Build the conceptual backbone for monetary and market extensions before implementation.

1. **Finalize Theoretical Foundation Document**

   * Expand and polish `PLANS/theory/Money_and_Markets_Theoretical_Foundation.md`.
   * Ensure it clearly distinguishes **quasilinear utility** (v1.3) and **instrumental value** (future), details budget constraints with integer money, and explains posted-price market mechanisms.

2. **Implementation Planning Document (Living Blueprint)**

   * Write `PLANS/implementation/money_and_markets_plan.md`.
   * Use narrative structure (as outlined in the ‚ÄúLiving Blueprint‚Äù guide): problem definition ‚Üí guiding principles ‚Üí architectural implications ‚Üí sequencing.
   * Explicitly define typing changes (e.g., adding `Good = "Money"`) and engine phase modifications required for market clearing.

3. **Architecture Diagram Update**

   * Add money and market components to the high-level system diagram.
   * Specify how the monetary module interacts with existing phases, preserving determinism.

**Deliverable:** Two well-written, version-controlled documents that lock down theory and plan.

---

### **Phase 3: Implementation of Money Module (v1.3)**

**Goal:** Introduce money as a third good with quasilinear utility, budget constraints, and monetary quotes‚Äîno markets yet.

1. **Typing & Schema Extensions**

   * Introduce `Money` as a good.
   * Update utility functions to include ŒªM.
   * Extend quote structures to allow bids/offers in money.

2. **Phase Integration**

   * Modify trade phase to treat money as the numeraire.
   * Ensure determinism and integer rounding rules are preserved.

3. **Scenario & Tests**

   * Create `scenarios/money_demo.yaml` demonstrating indirect exchange.
   * Write integration tests ensuring budget constraints and trade behavior are correct.

---

### **Phase 4: Market Mechanism Implementation (v1.4)**

**Goal:** Introduce local posted-price market clearing.

1. **Market Formation**

   * Partition agents into local markets each tick.

2. **Market Clearing Algorithm**

   * Implement posted-price auction: aggregate supply/demand, compute single clearing price, allocate trades deterministically.

3. **Integration & Tests**

   * Add scenarios and tests demonstrating emergent equilibrium prices.

This roadmap and checklist give you a concrete progression: **polish ‚Üí theory ‚Üí plan ‚Üí implement money ‚Üí implement markets**, matching both the narrative structure and the logical dependencies of the project. Each phase produces tangible, version-controlled deliverables that reduce cognitive load and keep theoretical clarity front and center.
