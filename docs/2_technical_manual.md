### The 7-Phase Tick Cycle

The simulation proceeds in discrete time steps called "ticks." Each tick, the engine executes 7 distinct phases in a fixed, deterministic order. This strict ordering is crucial for reproducibility and ensures that all agent actions are based on a consistent state of the world.

1.  **Perception**: Each agent observes its local environment within its `vision_radius`. This includes the positions of other agents, their broadcasted trade quotes, and the location of resources. To prevent race conditions, this perception is a **frozen snapshot** of the world at the beginning of the tick.

2.  **Decision**: Based on the perception snapshot, agents decide on actions and establish trade pairings using a **three-pass algorithm**:
    *   **Pass 1: Target Selection & Preference Ranking** ‚Äî Each agent (processed in ID order) evaluates all visible neighbors and builds a ranked preference list. Preferences are ranked by **distance-discounted surplus** = `surplus √ó Œ≤^distance`, where Œ≤ is the discount factor and distance is Manhattan distance. 
        - **Barter Surplus Calculation**: Agents use `compute_surplus()` which evaluates A‚ÜîB barter exchanges only.
        - **Inventory Feasibility**: The surplus estimator checks inventory constraints to prevent pairing when trades are impossible (e.g., if neither agent has goods to exchange).
        - **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation**: The surplus estimator uses **quote overlaps** (bid - ask price differences) as a heuristic proxy for actual utility gains. Quote overlaps may not perfectly predict true utility changes, especially with non-linear utility functions (CES, Quadratic) where the relationship between MRS and utility depends on function curvature. However, once paired, agents execute the ACTUAL best trade using full utility calculations, so they still achieve good outcomes. This design trades perfect accuracy for performance: O(1) per neighbor vs O(inventory_A √ó prices) for exact calculation.
    *   Agents skip neighbors in cooldown. Already-paired agents validate their pairing and maintain target lock.
    *   **Pass 2: Mutual Consent Pairing** ‚Äî Agents who mutually list each other as their top choice are paired via "mutual consent." Lower-ID agent executes the pairing to avoid duplication. Cooldowns are cleared for both agents.
    *   **Pass 3: Best-Available Fallback** ‚Äî Unpaired agents with remaining preferences use **surplus-based greedy matching**: all potential pairings are sorted by descending discounted surplus, and pairs are greedily assigned in order. When an agent claims a partner, that partner's target is updated to point back at the claimer (reciprocal commitment).
    *   **Resource Claiming**: When agents select forage targets, they **claim** the resource to prevent clustering (if `enable_resource_claiming=True`). Stale claims are cleared at the start of each tick.
    *   **Pairing Commitment**: Once paired, both agents commit exclusively to each other. They move toward each other and attempt trades until opportunities are exhausted (trade fails) or mode changes. Paired agents do not re-evaluate preferences or seek new partners until unpaired.

3.  **Movement**: Agents move towards their chosen targets (paired partner, resource, or other position) according to their `move_budget_per_tick`. Movement is deterministic, following specific tie-breaking rules (x-axis before y-axis, negative direction on ties, diagonal deadlock resolution by higher ID).

4.  **Trade**: Only **paired agents** within `interaction_radius` attempt trades. The engine uses a sophisticated price search algorithm to find mutually beneficial terms:
    *   **Barter Matching**: Direct A‚ÜîB goods exchange only
    *   **Compensating Block Search**: Scans trade sizes ŒîA from 1 to seller's inventory, testing candidate prices in [seller.ask, buyer.bid]
    *   **First-Acceptable-Trade Principle**: Accepts the first (ŒîA, ŒîB, price) tuple that yields strict utility gain (ŒîU > 0) for both parties
    *   **Trade Outcome**: Successful trades maintain pairing (agents attempt another trade next tick); failed trades unpair agents and set mutual cooldown

5.  **Foraging**: Agents located on a resource cell harvest that resource, increasing their inventory. The amount harvested is limited by the `forage_rate`.
    *   **Paired Agent Skip**: Paired agents skip foraging (exclusive commitment to trading).
    *   **Single-Harvester Enforcement**: If `enforce_single_harvester=True`, only one agent per resource cell can harvest per tick (determined by lowest `agent.id`).

6.  **Resource Regeneration**: Resource cells that have been harvested regenerate over time. A cell must wait `resource_regen_cooldown` ticks before it can begin regenerating at a rate of `resource_growth_rate` per tick.

7.  **Housekeeping**: The tick concludes with cleanup and maintenance tasks:
    *   **Quote Refresh**: Agents refresh their trade quotes if `inventory_changed` or `lambda_changed` flags are set
    *   **Pairing Integrity Checks**: Detect and repair asymmetric pairings (defensive validation)
    *   **Lambda Updates** (Phase 3+, KKT mode): Adaptive marginal utility estimation from neighbor prices
    *   **Telemetry Logging**: Agent snapshots, resource snapshots, tick states, pairing events, preferences logged to database

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Systems & Design Principles

### Determinism and Reproducibility

Determinism is the cornerstone of the VMT engine. Given the same scenario file and the same seed, the simulation will produce the exact same outcome every single time. This is achieved through several strict rules:

-   **Fixed Tick Order**: The 7-phase cycle never changes.
-   **Sorted Iteration**: All loops over agents are sorted by `agent.id`. All loops over potential trade pairs are sorted by `(min_id, max_id)`. There is no reliance on non-deterministic data structures like Python dictionaries for iteration.
-   **Deterministic Tie-Breaking**: Any situation that could be ambiguous is resolved with a fixed rule. For example, when choosing a movement path, agents prefer reducing distance on the x-axis before the y-axis, and prefer negative directions on ties.

### Economic Logic

#### Utility Functions
-   **Utility Functions**: The engine supports five utility function classes, all defined in `src/vmt_engine/econ/utility.py`:
    *   `UCES` ‚Äî Constant Elasticity of Substitution (including Cobb-Douglas as a special case)
    *   `ULinear` ‚Äî Perfect substitutes (constant marginal utility)
    *   `UQuadratic` ‚Äî Bliss points and satiation (non-monotonic preferences)
    *   `UTranslog` ‚Äî Transcendental logarithmic (flexible second-order approximation)
    *   `UStoneGeary` ‚Äî Subsistence constraints (foundation of Linear Expenditure System)
-   **Utility API**: The utility interface provides core methods:
    *   `u(A, B)` ‚Äî Utility from goods (canonical method)
    *   `u_goods(A, B)` ‚Äî Alias for `u(A, B)` (backward compatibility)
    *   `mu_A(A, B)`, `mu_B(A, B)` ‚Äî Marginal utilities of goods A and B (‚àÇU/‚àÇA, ‚àÇU/‚àÇB)
    *   `mu(A, B)` ‚Äî Returns tuple (MU_A, MU_B)
-   **Pure Barter Economy**: VMT is a pure barter economy - all trades are direct A‚ÜîB exchanges
-   **Reservation Bounds**: Agents' willingness to trade is determined by their reservation price, which is derived from their marginal rate of substitution (MRS). The engine uses a generic `reservation_bounds_A_in_B(A, B, eps)` function. This returns the minimum price an agent would accept (`p_min`) and the maximum price they would pay (`p_max`).
-   **Zero-Inventory Guard**: A critical feature is the handling of zero-inventory cases for CES utilities. When an agent has zero of a good, its MRS can be undefined or infinite. The engine handles this by adding a tiny `epsilon` value to the inventory levels *only for the ratio calculation* used to determine reservation bounds. The core utility calculation `u(A, B)` always uses the true integer inventories.

#### Agent Initialization and Heterogeneity
Agents are not required to be homogeneous. The `scenarios/*.yaml` format allows for specifying a distribution of preferences across the agent population.

-   **Utility Mix**: The `utilities.mix` section of a scenario file defines a list of one or more utility function configurations, each with a `type`, `params`, and a `weight`. The weights must sum to 1.0.
-   **Probabilistic Assignment**: During simulation setup, each agent's utility function is independently chosen from this list via weighted random sampling (`numpy.random.Generator.choice`). This means that a scenario can define, for example, a population composed of 80% CES agents and 20% Linear agents, each with their own specific parameters. An agent is assigned exactly one utility function.
-   **Initial Inventories**: Initial inventories can also be heterogeneous, specified either as a single value (all agents start the same) or as an explicit list of values, one for each agent.

##### Utility Function Details

**CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution)**:
- Parameters: `rho` (elasticity), `wA`, `wB` (weights)
- Special case: When `rho ‚Üí 0`, approaches Cobb-Douglas
- Properties: Monotonic, convex preferences, constant elasticity of substitution
- Use cases: Standard microeconomic analysis, variety-seeking behavior

**Linear (Perfect Substitutes)**:
- Parameters: `vA`, `vB` (per-unit values)
- Properties: Constant marginal rate of substitution (MRS = vA/vB)
- Use cases: Homogeneous goods, arbitrage scenarios, simple exchange

**Quadratic (Bliss Points)**:
- Parameters: `A_star`, `B_star` (bliss points), `sigma_A`, `sigma_B` (curvature), `gamma` (cross-curvature)
- Properties: Non-monotonic (satiation beyond bliss points), can have negative marginal utility
- Use cases: Demonstrations of satiation, gift economies, non-convex preferences
- Special handling: Agents may refuse trades when saturated (MU ‚â§ 0)

**Translog (Transcendental Logarithmic)**:
- Parameters: `alpha_0` (constant), `alpha_A`, `alpha_B` (first-order), `beta_AA`, `beta_BB`, `beta_AB` (second-order)
- Properties: Flexible functional form, variable elasticity of substitution, second-order Taylor approximation
- Use cases: Empirical estimation, production function analysis, testing functional form assumptions
- Special handling: Works in log-space for numerical stability, epsilon-shift for zero inventories

**Stone-Geary (Subsistence Constraints)**:
- Parameters: `alpha_A`, `alpha_B` (preference weights), `gamma_A`, `gamma_B` (subsistence levels)
- Properties: Subsistence thresholds, hyperbolic marginal utility near subsistence, nests Cobb-Douglas
- Use cases: Development economics, basic needs modeling, poverty analysis, LES demand systems
- Special handling: Requires initial inventories > subsistence; agents trade desperately when close to subsistence
- Important invariant: Scenarios must validate `initial_A > gamma_A` and `initial_B > gamma_B`
    
#### Quotes and Trading
-   **Quotes**: Agents maintain a dictionary of quotes (`Agent.quotes: dict[str, float]`) with keys for barter exchange:
    *   Barter: `"ask_A_in_B"`, `"bid_A_in_B"`, `"p_min_A_in_B"`, `"p_max_A_in_B"`, `"ask_B_in_A"`, `"bid_B_in_A"`, `"p_min_B_in_A"`, `"p_max_B_in_A"`
    *   Quotes are calculated from reservation bounds: `ask = p_min * (1 + spread)` and `bid = p_max * (1 - spread)`
-   **Barter Matching Algorithm**: The engine finds mutually beneficial A‚ÜîB trades:
    *   Function: `find_best_trade(agent_i, agent_j, params)` in `src/vmt_engine/systems/matching.py`
    *   Only A‚ÜîB barter trades are supported
-   **Price Search Algorithm**: Because goods are discrete integers, a price that looks good on paper (based on MRS) might not result in a mutually beneficial trade after rounding. The `find_compensating_block_generic` function solves this:
    *   Probes multiple prices within the valid `[ask_seller, bid_buyer]` range
    *   For each price, scans trade quantities from `ŒîA=1` up to seller's inventory
    *   Applies **round-half-up** rounding: `ŒîB = floor(price * ŒîA + 0.5)`
    *   Accepts the **first** trade block `(ŒîA, ŒîB)` that provides **strict utility improvement (ŒîU > 0)** for both agents
    *   This is the **first-acceptable-trade principle**, not highest-surplus search

### Behavioral Logic

#### Trade Cooldown
-   To prevent agents from getting stuck in futile loops (e.g., two agents repeatedly targeting each other but failing to find a valid trade block), the engine implements a trade cooldown.
-   After a failed trade attempt, a mutual cooldown is set for both agents for `trade_cooldown_ticks`. During this period, they will not consider each other as potential trading partners.

#### Foraging and Movement
-   **Foraging Target Score**: Agents decide which resource to pursue by calculating a score for each visible resource cell: `Score = ŒîU_arrival * Œ≤^dist`.
    -   `ŒîU_arrival` is the expected utility gain from harvesting the resource.
    -   `Œ≤` (beta) is the agent's time discount factor (0 < Œ≤ < 1).
    -   `dist` is the Manhattan distance to the cell.
-   This scoring mechanism means agents intelligently balance the richness of a resource patch against the time it will take to reach it.

#### Resource Claiming System
-   **Motivation**: Without coordination, multiple agents often target the same high-value resource, leading to inefficient clustering. Only one agent can harvest per tick, so others wait idle.
-   **Claiming Mechanism**: During Phase 2 (Decision), when an agent selects a forage target, it **claims** that resource by recording `resource_claims[position] = agent_id` in the simulation state. Other agents scanning for targets in the same tick see this resource as unavailable and choose alternatives.
-   **Claim Expiration**: Claims are transient and expire under two conditions:
    1. The agent reaches the resource cell (`agent.pos == claimed_pos`)
    2. The agent changes its target (`agent.target_pos != claimed_pos`)
-   **Stale Claim Clearing**: At the start of each tick's Decision phase, the engine clears all stale claims before agents make new decisions.
-   **Determinism**: Agents are processed in `agent.id` order during the Decision phase. Lower-ID agents claim resources first, ensuring consistent behavior across runs with the same seed.
-   **Configuration**: The system is controlled by two flags in `ScenarioParams`:
    -   `enable_resource_claiming` (default: `True`): Enables claim-based filtering
    -   `enforce_single_harvester` (default: `True`): During Phase 5 (Foraging), only the first agent (by ID) on a resource cell can harvest per tick
-   **Performance**: Claiming adds O(C) overhead where C = active claims (typically C ‚â§ N). Total decision complexity remains O(N*R). Single-harvester enforcement adds O(N) set operations during foraging.

#### Trade Pairing System
-   **Motivation**: Previous all-pairs matching was O(N¬≤) per tick. The pairing system reduces this to O(N) by establishing committed bilateral partnerships that persist across ticks.
-   **Three-Pass Algorithm**: See [Decision Phase](#the-7-phase-tick-cycle) above for full details. Summary:
    *   **Pass 1**: Build ranked preference lists using distance-discounted surplus = `surplus √ó Œ≤^distance`
    *   **Pass 2**: Mutual consent pairing (both agents list each other as top choice)
    *   **Pass 3**: Surplus-based greedy matching (highest-surplus unmatched pairs assigned first)
-   **Commitment Model**: Once paired, agents commit exclusively to each other:
    *   Move toward partner until within interaction radius
    *   Attempt trades each tick (may execute multiple trades across ticks)
    *   Ignore all other trading and foraging opportunities during pairing
    *   Unpair only when trade fails (opportunities exhausted) or mode changes
-   **Telemetry**: Three new tables track pairing dynamics:
    *   `pairings` ‚Äî Pairing/unpairing events with reason codes
    *   `preferences` ‚Äî Top-ranked agent preferences (default: top 3, configurable to full list)
    *   `decisions.is_paired` ‚Äî Boolean flag indicating pairing status
-   **Performance**: Reduces trade phase from O(N¬≤) distance checks to O(P) where P = paired count (typically P ‚â§ N/2). Decision phase remains O(N¬∑k) where k = average neighbors.
-   **Pedagogical Note**: Agents can commit to distant partners and spend many ticks moving toward them while ignoring other opportunities. Once paired, they execute multiple sequential trades. This demonstrates opportunity cost of commitment and iterative bilateral exchange.

#### Economic Decision-Making: Trade vs Forage Comparison
-   **Motivation**: When both trading and foraging are available (mode = "both"), agents must decide which activity offers higher utility gain. This is a fundamental economic choice: should I gather resources or exchange with others?
-   **Comparable Scoring**: Both activities are measured in utility units with identical distance discounting:
    *   **Trade score**: `surplus √ó Œ≤^distance` where surplus = bilateral utility gain from best feasible trade
    *   **Forage score**: `delta_u √ó Œ≤^distance` where delta_u = utility gain from harvesting best resource
    *   Both use the same Œ≤ (discount factor parameter), making direct comparison economically valid
-   **Decision Rule** (`_evaluate_trade_vs_forage` in `src/vmt_engine/systems/decision.py`):
    1.  Evaluate all visible trade partners, rank by discounted surplus (done in `_evaluate_trade_preferences`)
    2.  Evaluate all available resources, calculate best forage score using `choose_forage_target`
    3.  **Choose whichever activity has the higher score**
    4.  If trade chosen: Set target to best partner and participate in pairing algorithm
    5.  If forage chosen: Claim resource and set foraging commitment (persists until harvest)
-   **Example**: Agent with neighbors offering trade scores (5.2, 3.1) and forage opportunity with score 4.0:
    *   Agent chooses trading with best partner (5.2 > 4.0 > 3.1)
    *   If forage score were 6.0, agent would forage instead (6.0 > 5.2)
    *   This implements rational utility-maximizing behavior
-   **Mode Behavior**:
    *   **mode = "trade"**: Only trade opportunities evaluated (forage unavailable)
    *   **mode = "forage"**: Only forage opportunities evaluated (trade unavailable)
    *   **mode = "both"**: Full comparison as described above (economically optimal)
-   **Historical Note**: Prior to this implementation, agents used lexicographic preferences ("trade if any opportunity exists, otherwise forage"), which was not economically correct. The current system properly balances opportunity costs.

#### Trade System
-   **Pure Barter Economy**: All trades are direct A‚ÜîB good-for-good exchanges
-   **Mode Scheduling** (Implemented): Temporal control of agent activities:
    *   **`mode_schedule`**: WHEN activities occur (forage/trade/both modes)
    *   In forage mode, no trading occurs
    *   In trade/both modes, agents can engage in A‚ÜîB barter
-   **Matching**: 
    *   `find_best_trade()`: Finds first feasible A‚ÜîB barter trade
    *   `find_all_feasible_trades()`: Returns ALL feasible barter trades for ranking
    *   Uses compensating block search to find mutually beneficial exchanges
-   **Telemetry**: Trade telemetry logs A and B quantities exchanged, along with the price and surplus for each agent
