- Economically sound implementation of CES/Linear utilities with proper reservation pricing
- Clean separation of concerns across 7-phase tick cycle
- Comprehensive test coverage (55+ tests)
- Modern telemetry system using SQLite
- Well-documented type system and data contracts

Areas for Enhancement:
- Energy budget system (proposed, not implemented)
- Market mechanisms beyond bilateral barter
- Additional utility function types
- Performance optimization for very large simulations

## 1. Internal Consistency Analysis

### 1.1 Architecture Consistency ‚úÖ

The project maintains exceptional internal consistency across its architecture:

**7-Phase Tick Order** (Strictly Enforced):
1. Perception ‚Üí 2. Decision ‚Üí 3. Movement ‚Üí 4. Trade ‚Üí 5. Forage ‚Üí 6. Resource Regeneration ‚Üí 7. Housekeeping

This ordering is:
- Documented in multiple places (always consistent)
- Enforced in `simulation.py` through explicit system ordering
- Never violated in any system implementation
- Properly tested for determinism

**Determinism Guarantees** ‚úÖ:
- Agent iteration always by ascending `agent.id`
- Trade pairs processed by ascending `(min_id, max_id)`
- Tie-breaking rules consistently applied (lowest (x,y) lexicographically)
- RNG properly seeded with `np.random.Generator(np.random.PCG64(seed))`
- No use of sets/dicts for ordering-critical operations

### 1.2 Type System Consistency ‚úÖ

The type system documented in `docs/4_typing_overview.md` perfectly aligns with implementation:

- **Inventories**: Correctly typed as `int` (discrete quantities)
- **Prices**: Correctly typed as `float` (continuous exchange rates)
- **Positions**: Consistently `tuple[int, int]`
- **Resource amounts**: Properly `int` throughout

No type inconsistencies detected between documentation and implementation.

### 1.3 Parameter Naming Consistency ‚úÖ

Parameters are consistently named across:
- Schema definition (`schema.py`)
- YAML scenarios
- Simulation initialization
- System usage

Minor note: `dA_max` supports legacy `ŒîA_max` for backward compatibility (good practice).

### 1.4 Test-Implementation Alignment ‚úÖ

Tests accurately reflect implementation behavior:
- Trade rounding uses `floor(price * dA + 0.5)` consistently
- Reservation bounds properly handle zero inventories with epsilon shifts
- Resource regeneration follows documented cooldown semantics
- Trade cooldowns correctly prevent re-attempts

---

## 2. Economic Soundness Analysis

### 2.1 Utility Functions ‚úÖ

**CES Implementation** (EXCELLENT):
```python
U = [wA * A^œÅ + wB * B^œÅ]^(1/œÅ)
```
- Correctly handles œÅ ‚â† 1 constraint
- Proper limiting behavior for œÅ ‚Üí 0 (Cobb-Douglas)
- Zero inventory handling is economically sound

**MRS Calculation** ‚úÖ:
- Uses epsilon shift ONLY for zero inventories (correct)
- Never shifts for utility calculations (correct)
- Preserves analytic MRS for positive inventories

### 2.2 Trade Mechanics ‚úÖ

**Reservation Pricing** (EXCELLENT):
- Properly derives from utility functions
- `ask = p_min * (1 + spread)`, `bid = p_max * (1 - spread)`
- Default `spread = 0.0` gives true reservation prices
- Quotes refresh after inventory changes

**Price Discovery Algorithm** (INNOVATIVE) ‚úÖ:
The `find_compensating_block` function is particularly well-designed:
- Searches multiple prices within `[ask, bid]` range
- Targets integer `ŒîB` values (key for discrete trades)
- Uses proper round-half-up: `floor(price * ŒîA + 0.5)`
- Ensures strict utility improvement for BOTH parties

### 2.3 Foraging Economics ‚úÖ

**Distance-Discounted Utility**:
```python
score = ŒîU_from_harvest * Œ≤^distance
```
- Economically sound time/distance preference
- Œ≤ ‚àà (0,1] properly implements discounting
- Considers `forage_rate` not full cell amount (correct)

### 2.4 Resource Economics ‚úÖ

**Regeneration Model**:
- Cooldown period models recovery time (realistic)
- Growth rate capped at original amount (sustainable)
- Any harvest resets cooldown (prevents over-exploitation)

## 3. Code Quality Assessment

### 3.1 Code Organization ‚úÖ

**Excellent Separation of Concerns**:
