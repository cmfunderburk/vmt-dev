# VMT Documentation Review & Cleanup Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Purpose:** Identify outdated, redundant, or archival documentation  
**Status:** Recommendations for Developer Review

---

## Executive Summary

The `docs/` folder contains a mix of current documentation, historical research, review notes, and temporary files. This review identifies which files are:
- ✅ **KEEP** - Current, accurate, and essential
- 📦 **ARCHIVE** - Historical but valuable for reference
- 🗑️ **DELETE** - Temporary, redundant, or obsolete

---

## Current Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── [CORE] Active documentation
├── DEEP/ - Historical research and analysis
├── REVIEW/ - Point-in-time review documents
├── proposals/ - Design proposals (active)
├── structures/ - Scenario reference (NEW, current)
└── tmp/ - Temporary implementation summaries
```

## Recommendations by Directory

### **Root Documentation (docs/) - ✅ KEEP ALL**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `1_project_overview.md` | ✅ KEEP | Core user documentation, recently updated |
| `2_technical_manual.md` | ✅ KEEP | Essential technical reference, recently updated |
| `3_strategic_roadmap.md` | ✅ KEEP | Current development priorities, recently updated |
| `4_typing_overview.md` | ✅ KEEP | Type specifications, recently updated |
| `scenario_configuration_guide.md` | ✅ KEEP | Comprehensive parameter reference, current |
| `CHANGELOG_DOCUMENTATION.md` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Tracks documentation changes |

**Action:** None - all current and essential

---

### **docs/structures/ - ✅ KEEP ALL**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `comprehensive_scenario_template.yaml` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Complete parameter reference |
| `parameter_quick_reference.md` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Quick lookup tables |
| `minimal_working_example.yaml` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Minimal scenario template |
| `money_example.yaml` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Monetary scenario template |
| `README.md` | ✅ KEEP | NEW - Guide for structure files |

**Action:** None - all newly created and essential

---

### **docs/DEEP/ - 📦 RECOMMENDED: ARCHIVE**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `research_gpt_project_overview.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Historical research analysis (2025-10-21), valuable but superseded |
| `economic_logic_research_prompt.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Research methodology, historical value |
| `VMT – Visualizing Microeconomic Theory_ Updated Project Plan (Oct 2025).md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | October 2025 planning doc, superseded by current roadmap |

**Rationale:**
- These files capture important research and design decisions from the money system implementation
- They provide historical context for why certain decisions were made
- They are superseded by current documentation but have archival value
- Not needed for day-to-day development or user guidance

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-money-system-research
mv docs/DEEP/* docs/archive/2025-10-money-system-research/
rmdir docs/DEEP
```

**Alternative:** Keep DEEP/ but add a README explaining it's historical research

---

### **docs/REVIEW/ - 📦 RECOMMENDED: ARCHIVE**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `2025-10-21_alignment_vs_initial_plan.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Point-in-time review, P0 issues now resolved |
| `2025-10-21_architecture_and_docs_review.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Point-in-time review, recommendations now implemented |
| `2025-10-21_modularization_roadmap_protocols.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Early protocol modularization thinking, superseded by v3 plan |

**Rationale:**
- These are point-in-time review documents from October 21, 2025
- They identified P0 pairing-trading mismatch (now resolved)
- They identified missing documentation (now created)
- They are superseded by current proposals and roadmap
- Historical value for understanding the evolution of the project

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-21-review
mv docs/REVIEW/* docs/archive/2025-10-21-review/
rmdir docs/REVIEW
```

---

### **docs/proposals/ - ✅ KEEP (with cleanup)**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `README.md` | ✅ KEEP | Explains proposal process |
| `protocol_modularization_plan_v3.md` | ✅ KEEP | Current active proposal |
| `protocol_modularization_plan.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | v1 superseded by v3 |
| `protocol_modularization_v2_resolution.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | v2 superseded by v3 |
| `protocol_modularization_discussion.md` | 📦 ARCHIVE | Early discussion, now formalized in v3 |

**Rationale:**
- v3 plan is the current active proposal
- v1, v2, and discussion docs are superseded
- v3 incorporates all previous thinking
- Historical versions have value for understanding evolution

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/proposals/archive
mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_plan.md docs/proposals/archive/
mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_v2_resolution.md docs/proposals/archive/
mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_discussion.md docs/proposals/archive/
```

**Update README.md:**
```markdown
## Active Proposals
- **[Protocol Modularization v3](protocol_modularization_plan_v3.md)** - Current plan
  - [Archived versions](archive/) - Historical evolution of the proposal
```

---

### **docs/tmp/ - 🗑️ RECOMMENDED: DELETE or ARCHIVE**

| File | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `P0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | 🗑️ DELETE | Temporary summary of completed work (P0 resolved 2025-10-22) |

**Rationale:**
- This is a temporary implementation summary
- P0 pairing-trading mismatch is now resolved
- Information is incorporated into CHANGELOG_DOCUMENTATION.md
- No ongoing reference value

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
# Option 1: Delete entirely
rm -rf docs/tmp/

# Option 2: Archive if you want to keep the history
mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-22-p0-resolution
mv docs/tmp/* docs/archive/2025-10-22-p0-resolution/
rmdir docs/tmp
```

## Detailed Analysis

### **DEEP/ Directory**

**Purpose:** Research and deep analysis documents from money system implementation

**Value:**
- ✅ Captures important economic and architectural reasoning
- ✅ Documents the thought process behind money system design
- ✅ Useful for understanding why certain decisions were made
- ⚠️ NOT needed for current development or user guidance

**Recommendation:** Archive with clear naming to preserve historical context

**Justification:**
- These documents were critical during the money system implementation
- They are now superseded by the integrated documentation
- They have archival value for understanding project evolution
- They clutter the docs/ root directory

---

### **REVIEW/ Directory**

**Purpose:** Point-in-time architectural and documentation reviews from 2025-10-21

**Value:**
- ✅ Identified P0 pairing-trading mismatch (NOW RESOLVED)
- ✅ Identified missing documentation (NOW CREATED)
- ✅ Identified protocol modularization need (NOW IN ROADMAP)
- ⚠️ Recommendations already implemented or incorporated into roadmap

**Recommendation:** Archive as historical record

**Justification:**
- These reviews drove the recent documentation and code improvements
- Their recommendations are now implemented or in the roadmap
- They provide historical context for why changes were made
- No longer needed for active development

---

### **proposals/ Directory**

**Purpose:** Design proposals for major architectural changes

**Value:**
- ✅ v3 plan is current and active
- ✅ v1, v2, and discussion docs show evolution of thinking
- ⚠️ Multiple versions can cause confusion

**Recommendation:** Keep v3, archive earlier versions in proposals/archive/

**Justification:**
- v3 plan incorporates all previous thinking
- Historical versions useful for understanding design evolution
- Keeping in proposals/ with clear structure maintains lineage
- README should clarify that v3 is current

---

### **tmp/ Directory**

**Purpose:** Temporary implementation summaries

**Value:**
- ✅ Documented P0 resolution process
- ⚠️ Information now in CHANGELOG_DOCUMENTATION.md
- ⚠️ P0 work is complete

**Recommendation:** Delete or archive

**Justification:**
- Temporary directory with completed work
- No ongoing reference value
- Information captured in changelog
- Clutters documentation structure

---

## Recommended Actions

### **Immediate (High Priority)**

1. **Archive DEEP/ directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-money-system-research
   mv docs/DEEP/* docs/archive/2025-10-money-system-research/
   rmdir docs/DEEP
   ```

2. **Archive REVIEW/ directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-21-review
   mv docs/REVIEW/* docs/archive/2025-10-21-review/
   rmdir docs/REVIEW
   ```

3. **Clean up proposals/:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/proposals/archive
   mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_plan.md docs/proposals/archive/
   mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_v2_resolution.md docs/proposals/archive/
   mv docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_discussion.md docs/proposals/archive/
   ```

4. **Delete tmp/ directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf docs/tmp/
   ```

### **Optional (Nice to Have)**

5. **Add archive README:**
   ```bash
   # Create docs/archive/README.md explaining archival structure
   ```

6. **Update proposals/README.md:**
   - Clarify that v3 is current
   - Add note about archived versions

---

## Benefits of Cleanup

## Validation Checklist

Before archiving/deleting, verify:
- [ ] No active links to archived files from current documentation
- [ ] All important information captured in current docs
- [ ] Archive structure is logical and documented
- [ ] README files explain archival organization

---

## Post-Cleanup Documentation Structure

After cleanup, the `docs/` folder will contain:

**Active Documentation:**
- Core guides (1-4, scenario config, changelog)
- Scenario structures/ (templates and references)
- Active proposals/ (with v3 plan)

**Archived Documentation:**
- Historical research (money system implementation)
- Point-in-time reviews (2025-10-21)
- Completed implementation summaries (P0 resolution)
- Superseded proposal versions

**Benefits:**
- Clean, navigable structure
- Historical record preserved
- Clear separation of current vs. historical
- Easy onboarding for new contributors

---

**Recommendation:** Proceed with archival strategy to maintain clean, current documentation while preserving historical context.
