## 2025-01-27: Implementation Status Clarification

**Purpose:** Comprehensive review and update of all documentation to accurately reflect current implementation status versus planned features.

### **Root Cause**
During the implementation of the money system and creation of comprehensive scenario documentation, we identified that several features were documented as "implemented" when they were actually "planned":
- `kkt_lambda` money mode
- `mixed_liquidity_gated` exchange regime  
- Associated parameters (`lambda_update_rate`, `lambda_bounds`, `liquidity_gate`)

Additionally, we identified the critical need for protocol modularization before proceeding with Phase C market mechanisms.

### **Files Updated**

#### **Core Documentation**
1. **README.md**
   - Rewrote to clearly distinguish implemented vs. planned features
   - Added "Development Status" section with completed and planned items
   - Updated feature descriptions to reflect current capabilities
   - Emphasized heterogeneous lambda values for monetary trading

2. **docs/1_project_overview.md**
   - Updated money system section: 3 exchange regimes (not 4)
   - Marked kkt_lambda and mixed_liquidity_gated as planned
   - Clarified quasilinear mode is current implementation
   - Added notes about heterogeneous lambda values

3. **docs/2_technical_manual.md**
   - Changed "Phases 1-4 Complete" to "Core Implementation Complete"
   - Removed confusing phase numbering
   - Marked planned features explicitly
   - Updated all sections to use "Implemented" or "Planned" tags

4. **docs/3_strategic_roadmap.md**
   - Complete rewrite to reflect current state
   - Added Protocol Modularization as Priority 1
   - Moved Phase C Market Prototype to Priority 2 (after refactor)
   - Added "Technical Debt & Refactoring Needs" section
   - Clarified Phase A & B are complete, Phase C requires refactor first

5. **docs/4_typing_overview.md**
   - Updated all `[IMPLEMENTED Phase X]` tags to just `[IMPLEMENTED]` or `[PLANNED]`
   - Clarified exchange regime implementation status individually
   - Added implementation status clarification to specification history
   - Removed confusing phase numbering

#### **Scenario Configuration Documentation**
6. **docs/scenario_configuration_guide.md**
   - No changes needed (already accurate)

7. **docs/structures/comprehensive_scenario_template.yaml** (NEW)
   - Created complete parameter reference with valid ranges
   - Added implementation status section
   - Marked planned features explicitly
   - Emphasized heterogeneous lambda importance

8. **docs/structures/parameter_quick_reference.md** (NEW)
   - Created quick lookup tables for all parameters
   - Added implementation status notes
   - Included heterogeneous lambda section

9. **docs/structures/minimal_working_example.yaml** (NEW)
   - Created minimal working scenario example

10. **docs/structures/money_example.yaml** (NEW)
    - Created monetary scenario example with heterogeneous lambda

11. **docs/structures/README.md** (NEW)
    - Created guide for using all structure reference files

#### **Cursor Rules (AI Context)**
12. **.cursor/rules/vmt-economic-models.mdc**
    - Updated exchange regimes with implementation status
    - Changed "DEFERRED" to "PLANNED" for consistency
    - Added money modes with status tags

13. **.cursor/rules/vmt-scenarios-config.mdc**
    - Updated exchange regime comment to note mixed_liquidity_gated is planned

14. **.cursor/rules/vmt-development-workflow.mdc**
    - Changed "Deferred Features" to "Planned Features"
    - Added protocol modularization and Phase C to planned list
    - Added "Current Development Priority" section
    - Updated status date to 2025-01-27

### **Terminology Standardization**

**Old (Inconsistent):**
- "Phases 1-4 Complete"
- "Phase 2+", "Phase 3+"
- "DEFERRED"
- Mix of phase numbering systems

**New (Consistent):**
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` - Feature is fully working
- `[PLANNED]` - Feature is designed but not yet built
- `[DEPRECATED]` - Feature is obsolete
- No confusing phase numbering in implementation docs

### **Key Messages Established**

1. **Money System (v1.0) is Complete** - Three exchange regimes, quasilinear mode, heterogeneous lambda
2. **KKT Lambda is Planned** - Not yet implemented, along with lambda_update_rate and lambda_bounds
3. **Mixed Liquidity Gated is Planned** - Not yet implemented, along with liquidity_gate parameters
4. **Protocol Modularization Required** - Critical architectural work before Phase C
5. **Heterogeneous Lambda Recommended** - Essential for realistic monetary trading dynamics

### **Documentation Quality Improvements**

1. **Accuracy** - All docs now reflect actual implementation status
2. **Consistency** - Same terminology across all documents
3. **Clarity** - Clear distinction between current and future features
4. **Honesty** - No overpromising on planned features
5. **Completeness** - Added comprehensive parameter reference materials

### **Files Created**

New comprehensive reference materials in `docs/structures/`:
- `comprehensive_scenario_template.yaml` - Complete parameter reference
- `parameter_quick_reference.md` - Quick lookup tables
- `minimal_working_example.yaml` - Minimal working scenario
- `money_example.yaml` - Monetary scenario example
- `README.md` - Guide for using structure files

### **Validation**

All updated files:
- ✅ Pass linter checks (no errors)
- ✅ Internally consistent
- ✅ Aligned with codebase reality
- ✅ Clear about implementation status
- ✅ Emphasize best practices (heterogeneous lambda)
