# VMT - Visualizing Microeconomic Theory

**A spatial agent-based simulation investigating how market phenomena emerge from micro-level interactions.**

> **Core Research/Pedagogical Question:** Under what institutional conditions do market-like phenomena actually emerge from individual agent behaviors?

Rather than assuming equilibrium prices exist and agents take them as given, VMT demonstrates how markets form (or fail to form) through explicit institutional mechanisms‚Äîsearch protocols, matching algorithms, and bargaining rules. Agents with heterogeneous preferences forage for resources on a spatial grid and discover exchange opportunities through bilateral negotiation, with prices emerging endogenously from their interactions.

**For the complete strategic vision and research agenda, see:** [`docs/BIGGEST_PICTURE/vision_and_architecture.md`](BIGGEST_PICTURE/vision_and_architecture.md)

---

## Philosophy: Markets as Emergent Phenomena

Traditional economics education jumps quickly from individual agents to abstract equilibrium concepts, treating markets and prices as given primitives. VMT inverts this approach:

**Standard Economics:** Utility ‚Üí Demand ‚Üí Market Clearing ‚Üí Equilibrium Price *(assumed to exist/be supported by some ill-defined institutions)*

**VMT Approach:** Utility ‚Üí MRS ‚Üí Reservation Prices ‚Üí **Search** ‚Üí **Matching** ‚Üí **Bargaining** ‚Üí Trade ‚Üí *Observed Exchange Ratios*

The middle steps‚Äîsearch, matching, and bargaining‚Äîare **explicit institutional mechanisms** that may or may not produce price convergence. This enables:

- **Institutional Comparison:** Different protocols produce different market outcomes
- **Emergence Analysis:** When do bilateral negotiations converge to uniform prices?
- **Pedagogical Clarity:** Markets don't "just happen"‚Äîthey require specific institutions
- **Research Applications:** Systematic study of market formation conditions

## üìä Telemetry & Analysis

VMT uses a **SQLite database** (`./logs/telemetry.db`) for all logging.

### Database Schema

The telemetry database includes comprehensive tables:
- **`simulation_runs`** ‚Äî Run metadata with exchange_regime, money_mode
- **`agent_snapshots`** ‚Äî Per-tick agent state (position, inventory, utility, quotes, lambda)
- **`trades`** ‚Äî Successful trades with exchange pair type, money transfers, surplus decomposition
- **`decisions`** ‚Äî Agent decision outcomes with pairing status
- **`pairings`** ‚Äî Pairing/unpairing events with reason codes
- **`preferences`** ‚Äî Agent preference rankings (top 3 by default)
- **`tick_states`** ‚Äî Per-tick mode and regime state
- **`resource_snapshots`** ‚Äî Grid resource state over time

### Interactive Log Viewer

Use the PyQt6-based log viewer to explore simulation data:

```bash
python view_logs.py
```

The viewer allows you to:
- Scrub through the simulation timeline tick-by-tick
- Analyze individual agent states, trajectories, and trade histories
- Visualize trade attempts and statistics with full money/pairing context
- Filter by exchange regime, pairing status, and trade type
- Export data to CSV for external analysis

### Python API

For programmatic analysis, you can still run simulations and access data directly in Python.

```python
from vmt_engine.simulation import Simulation
from scenarios.loader import load_scenario

# Load scenario
scenario = load_scenario("scenarios/three_agent_barter.yaml")

# Create simulation with seed
sim = Simulation(scenario, seed=42)

# Run for 100 ticks
sim.run(max_ticks=100)

# Access results
for agent in sim.agents:
    A, B = agent.inventory.A, agent.inventory.B
    U = agent.utility.u(A, B)
    print(f"Agent {agent.id}: A={A}, B={B}, U={U:.2f}")
```

## Creating Custom Scenarios

### Current Recommended Workflow: Manual YAML Creation

**The canonical method for creating scenarios is to use the templates and examples in [`docs/structures/`](docs/structures/):**

1. **Browse Templates:**
   - [`minimal_working_example.yaml`](docs/structures/minimal_working_example.yaml) - Simplest valid scenario
   - [`comprehensive_scenario_template.yaml`](docs/structures/comprehensive_scenario_template.yaml) - All parameters documented
   - [`money_example.yaml`](docs/structures/money_example.yaml) - Monetary economy setup
   - [`parameter_quick_reference.md`](docs/structures/parameter_quick_reference.md) - Parameter documentation

2. **Copy and Modify:**
   ```bash
   # Copy a template
   cp docs/structures/minimal_working_example.yaml scenarios/my_scenario.yaml
   
   # Edit with your preferred editor
   vim scenarios/my_scenario.yaml  # or code, nano, etc.
   ```

3. **Review Examples:**
   - Check `scenarios/demos/` for annotated pedagogical scenarios
   - Review `scenarios/test/` for specific feature demonstrations
   - See existing scenarios for parameter combinations that work well

**Note:** CLI and GUI scenario generation tools were removed (2025-10-27) as they were outdated. Manual YAML editing with templates is the canonical workflow.

### Scenario Example

```yaml
schema_version: 1
name: three_agent_barter
N: 32  # Grid size (32√ó32)
agents: 3

initial_inventories:
  A: [8, 4, 6]  # Per-agent initial A
  B: [4, 8, 6]  # Per-agent initial B

utilities:
  mix:
    - type: ces
      weight: 1.0
      params:
        rho: -0.5    # Complementarity
        wA: 1.0
        wB: 1.0

params:
  # Trading
  spread: 0.0                    # Bid-ask spread (0 = true reservation prices)
  trade_cooldown_ticks: 5        # Cooldown after failed trade
  
  # Resources
  resource_growth_rate: 1        # Units regenerating per tick
  resource_regen_cooldown: 5     # Ticks to wait after harvest
  
  # Foraging
  vision_radius: 5               # Perception range
  forage_rate: 1                 # Units harvested per tick
  beta: 0.95                     # Time discount factor

resource_seed:
  density: 0.15                  # Fraction of cells with resources
  amount: 3                      # Initial resource amount
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Resource Claiming

**Enabled by default** (`enable_resource_claiming: true`), the resource claiming system coordinates agent foraging to reduce inefficient clustering:

- **Claiming Mechanism**: During the Decision phase, agents **claim** forage targets by recording `resource_claims[position] = agent_id`
- **Claim Filtering**: Other agents see claimed resources as unavailable and select alternatives
- **Deterministic**: Lower-ID agents claim resources first (processed in ID order)
- **Stale Clearing**: Claims expire when agents reach the resource or change targets
- **Single-Harvester**: Only the first agent (by ID) at a cell harvests per tick (`enforce_single_harvester: true`)
- **Benefits**: Reduces clustering; increases spatial distribution; improves resource utilization

See [Technical Manual](./2_technical_manual.md#resource-claiming-system) for implementation details.

## üí∞ Money System

VMT implements a flexible money system with configurable **utility forms** and **exchange regimes**:

### Exchange Regimes

The `exchange_regime` parameter controls allowed exchange types:
- **`"barter_only"`** (default) ‚Äî Only A‚ÜîB trades; backward compatible with legacy scenarios
- **`"money_only"`** ‚Äî Only A‚ÜîM and B‚ÜîM trades (goods for money)
- **`"mixed"`** ‚Äî All exchange pairs allowed; generic matching selects highest-surplus pair
- **`"mixed_liquidity_gated"`** ‚Äî (PLANNED) Barter fallback when money market is thin

### Money Utility Forms

VMT supports two functional forms for money utility:

#### 1. Linear Form (Quasilinear)
```
U_total = U_goods(A, B) + Œª¬∑M
‚àÇU/‚àÇM = Œª (constant marginal utility)
```

#### 2. Logarithmic Form (Diminishing MU)
```
U_total = U_goods(A, B) + Œª¬∑log(M + M_0)
‚àÇU/‚àÇM = Œª/(M + M_0) (diminishing marginal utility)
```

Where:
- **U_goods** ‚Äî Utility from goods (CES, Linear, Quadratic, Translog, or Stone-Geary)
- **Œª** (`lambda_money`) ‚Äî Base marginal utility parameter (default: 1.0)
- **M** ‚Äî Money holdings in minor units (e.g., cents)
- **M_0** ‚Äî Shift parameter for log form (subsistence money level, default: 0.0)

### Configuration Examples

#### Linear Form (Constant MU)
```yaml
initial_inventories:
  A: { uniform_int: [5, 15] }
  B: { uniform_int: [5, 15] }
  M: 100  # Give each agent 100 units of money

params:
  exchange_regime: "mixed"         # Allow all exchange types
  money_utility_form: "linear"     # Constant marginal utility (default)
  lambda_money: 1.0                # Marginal utility of money
  money_scale: 1                   # Minor units scale
```

#### Logarithmic Form (Diminishing MU)
```yaml
initial_inventories:
  A: { uniform_int: [5, 15] }
  B: { uniform_int: [5, 15] }
  M: 100  # Give each agent 100 units of money

params:
  exchange_regime: "mixed"         # Allow all exchange types
  money_utility_form: "log"        # Diminishing marginal utility
  lambda_money: 10.0               # Base MU parameter
  M_0: 10.0                       # Subsistence money level
  money_scale: 1                   # Minor units scale
```

**Note:** `lambda_money` can be a list for heterogeneous agents (e.g., `[1.0, 2.0, 0.5]`)

### Telemetry

Money trades are logged with full context:
- **`trades.dM`** ‚Äî Money transfer amount
- **`trades.exchange_pair_type`** ‚Äî "A<->B", "A<->M", "B<->M"
- **`trades.buyer_lambda`**, **`trades.seller_lambda`** ‚Äî Lambda values at trade time
- **`tick_states.active_pairs`** ‚Äî JSON array of active exchange pairs per tick

See [Technical Manual](./2_technical_manual.md#money-system) and [Type Specification](./4_typing_overview.md#7-money--market-contracts) for complete details.

## üéì Academic Use & Key Research Themes

This project makes 'institutional' details, like bargaining protocols/price discovery mechanisms, explicit:

### Research Applications
- **Price Convergence Conditions:** When do exchange ratios converge to uniform "prices"?
- **Bilateral vs Centralized:** When does decentralized exchange approximate Walrasian equilibrium?
- **Institutional Details:** How do specific protocol features affect market outcomes?
- **Spatial Dynamics:** How do search costs and market thickness affect efficiency?

### Pedagogical Features
- **Markets as Constructions:** Students see markets built from institutional rules
- **Comparative Analysis:** Different protocols produce visibly different outcomes
- **Observable Convergence:** Watch price formation (or dispersion) tick-by-tick
- **No Assumptions:** Price-taking emerges (or doesn't) from mechanisms, not axioms
- **Spatial Reasoning:** Information frictions and search costs are endogenous

### Suggested Exercises

1. **Vary complementarity** - Change CES `rho` from -2 to +2, observe trading patterns
2. **Bootstrap experiments** - Compare [10,0] vs [8,2] initial inventories
3. **Regeneration rates** - Test sustainable foraging with different `resource_growth_rate`
4. **Cooldown tuning** - How does `trade_cooldown_ticks` affect exploration?
5. **Mixed populations** - Combine CES and Linear agents, analyze welfare

### New Utility Function Demonstrations

The following scenarios demonstrate the three new utility functions:

1. **bliss_point_demo.yaml** - Quadratic utility with agents seeking optimal (bliss point) inventories
   - Demonstrates satiation behavior and non-monotonic preferences
   - Agents refuse trades when inventories exceed bliss points

2. **translog_estimation_demo.yaml** - Mixed population with Translog and CES utilities
   - Shows variable elasticity of substitution across inventory levels
   - Useful for empirical estimation exercises and functional form comparisons

3. **subsistence_economy_demo.yaml** - Stone-Geary utility with subsistence constraints
   - Demonstrates desperate trading when agents are close to subsistence
   - Shows market segmentation between subsistence and normal traders
   - Models basic needs vs. discretionary consumption

4. **mixed_utility_showcase.yaml** - All three new utilities in a heterogeneous population
   - Demonstrates architectural flexibility
   - Rich diversity of trading patterns and economic behaviors
