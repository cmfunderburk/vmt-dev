Great! Let's brainstorm target arrow visualization. First, let me understand what targeting information is available in the simulation.

[5 tools called]

Perfect! Now I can see the target information available. In the Decision phase, each agent sets:
- `agent.target_pos`: Position they're moving toward
- `agent.target_agent_id`: ID of target agent (if pursuing trade) or None (if foraging)

Let me brainstorm visualization approaches for target arrows:

## **Target Arrow Visualization Brainstorming**

### **Approach 1: Simple Arrows from Agent to Target**
**Concept:** Draw straight arrows from each agent's position to their `target_pos`.

**Visual Design Options:**
- **Color coding:**
  - Trade targets (agent→agent): Green arrows
  - Forage targets (agent→resource): Orange/brown arrows
  - Idle (no target): No arrow
- **Arrow style:**
  - Solid line with arrowhead
  - Thickness: 2-3px
  - Semi-transparent (alpha ~0.7) to avoid clutter

**Pros:**
- Very clear and intuitive
- Shows movement intentions immediately
- Easy to see which resources are being contested
- Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- Can be cluttered with many agents
- Overlapping arrows hard to distinguish
- May obscure grid/agents

---

### **Approach 2: Curved/Bezier Arrows**
**Concept:** Use curved arrows instead of straight lines to reduce visual overlap.

**Visual Design:**
- Generate slight curves based on agent IDs (deterministic)
- Higher ID agents curve clockwise, lower counter-clockwise
- Reduces overlap when multiple agents target same position

**Pros:**
- More elegant visually
- Less overlap than straight arrows
- Professional appearance

**Cons:**
- More complex rendering (pygame bezier curves)
- May be harder to judge exact target location
- Performance cost for curve calculation

---

### **Approach 3: Directional Indicator (Near Agent)**
**Concept:** Instead of full arrow, show small directional indicator next to each agent.

**Visual Design:**
- Small triangle/wedge pointing toward target
- Positioned at edge of agent circle
- Color coded by target type (trade vs forage)
- Size scales with distance to target

**Pros:**
- Minimal clutter
- Keeps focus on agents
- Works well at small cell sizes
- Clear even with co-located agents

**Cons:**
- Less precise than full arrows
- May be hard to see which specific target
- Doesn't show mutual targeting clearly

---

### **Approach 4: Layered/Toggle Visualization**
**Concept:** Different arrow rendering modes controlled by keyboard:
- Press `T` to toggle Trade arrows only
- Press `F` to toggle Forage arrows only  
- Press `A` to toggle All arrows
- Press `O` to toggle arrows Off

**Visual Design:**
- Start with arrows off (cleaner default)
- User can inspect specific aspects on demand
- Could also show different info on HUD when toggled

**Pros:**
- User controls information density
- Can focus on specific aspects (just trade, just forage)
- Good for demonstrations/teaching
- Reduces clutter by default

**Cons:**
- Requires learning keyboard controls
- May forget what mode you're in
- Need visual indicator of current mode

---

### **Approach 5: Mutual Targeting Highlights**
**Concept:** Special visualization for pairs of agents targeting each other.

**Visual Design:**
- Regular arrows: thin, semi-transparent
- **Mutual arrows**: thicker, pulsing, or animated
- Show "lock" icon or connecting line between mutual targets
- Helps identify actual trading pairs vs one-sided pursuit

**Pros:**
- Highlights economically important relationships
- Shows which agents will actually interact
- Good pedagogical value (shows matching process)
- Emphasizes bilateral nature of trade

**Cons:**
- May miss lone agents pursuing trades
- More complex state tracking
- Could be confusing if not explained

---

### **Approach 6: Gradient/Fade Based on Distance**
**Concept:** Arrow opacity/thickness decreases with distance to target.

**Visual Design:**
- Close targets: thick, opaque arrows
- Far targets: thin, faded arrows
- Emphasizes agents about to interact
- De-emphasizes long-distance pursuit

**Pros:**
- Reduces visual noise from distant targets
- Focuses attention on imminent interactions
- Aesthetically pleasing
- Natural priority visualization

**Cons:**
- May miss important long-distance pursuits
- More calculation per frame
- Might be too subtle

---

### **Approach 7: Target Position Markers**
**Concept:** Instead of arrows from agents, mark target positions with indicators.

**Visual Design:**
- Small circle/crosshair at each target position
- Number showing how many agents targeting it
- Color coded: green for single, yellow for contested (2-3), red for hot (4+)
- Optional: thin lines connecting agents to their shared target

**Pros:**
- Shows competition/crowding clearly
- Less cluttered than individual arrows
- Good for analyzing resource contention
- Unique visualization approach

**Cons:**
- Harder to trace individual agent intentions
- May be confusing which agent goes where
- Less intuitive than arrows

---

### **Approach 8: Animated/Progressive Arrows**
**Concept:** Arrows animate over time to show directionality.

**Visual Design:**
- Dashed arrows with moving dash pattern
- Small circle travels along arrow path
- Arrow "grows" from agent to target each tick
- Creates sense of motion

**Pros:**
- Eye-catching
- Clear directionality
- Professional appearance
- Shows dynamic nature of simulation

**Cons:**
- Performance overhead
- Can be distracting
- Requires animation frame management
- May be harder to screenshot/analyze

---

## **Technical Considerations**

### **Data Access (Easy!):**
```python
for agent in sim.agents:
    if agent.target_pos is not None:
        target_type = "trade" if agent.target_agent_id is not None else "forage"
        # Draw arrow from agent.pos to agent.target_pos
```

### **Arrow Rendering in Pygame:**

**Simple line arrow:**
```python
def draw_arrow(surface, start, end, color, width=2):
    # Draw line
    pygame.draw.line(surface, color, start, end, width)
    
    # Calculate arrowhead
    angle = math.atan2(end[1] - start[1], end[0] - start[0])
    arrow_len = 8
    arrow_angle = math.pi / 6
    
    # Arrowhead points
    p1 = (end[0] - arrow_len * math.cos(angle - arrow_angle),
          end[1] - arrow_len * math.sin(angle - arrow_angle))
    p2 = (end[0] - arrow_len * math.cos(angle + arrow_angle),
          end[1] - arrow_len * math.sin(angle + arrow_angle))
    
    # Draw arrowhead
    pygame.draw.polygon(surface, color, [end, p1, p2])
```

**Optimization for large grids:**
- Only render arrows for visible agents (use camera culling)
- Batch similar arrows together
- Cache arrow calculations when target doesn't change

---

## **My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Implement **Approach 1** (Simple arrows) with **Approach 4** (Toggle controls)
- Simple straight arrows, color-coded by type
- Toggle with `T` key to show/hide
- Default to OFF for clean initial view
- Show toggle state in HUD

**Phase 2 (Enhancement):** Add **Approach 5** (Mutual targeting highlights)
- Detect when two agents target each other
- Draw thicker/brighter arrows for mutual pairs
- Shows which trades are likely to happen

**Phase 3 (Polish):** Add **Approach 6** (Distance-based fading)
- Fade distant arrows to reduce clutter
- Keep close interactions prominent

**Visual Specifications:**
```python
# Arrow colors (with alpha)
COLOR_ARROW_TRADE = (100, 255, 100, 180)      # Green, semi-transparent
COLOR_ARROW_FORAGE = (255, 165, 0, 180)       # Orange, semi-transparent  
COLOR_ARROW_MUTUAL = (255, 255, 100, 230)     # Bright yellow, more opaque
COLOR_ARROW_IDLE = (150, 150, 150, 120)       # Gray, very transparent

# Arrow dimensions
ARROW_WIDTH = 2
ARROW_WIDTH_MUTUAL = 3
ARROW_HEAD_LENGTH = 8
ARROW_HEAD_ANGLE = 30  # degrees
```

## **Questions to Refine Design:**

1. **Default state:** Arrows visible by default, or hidden until toggled?
2. **Arrow targets:** Show forage arrows, trade arrows, or both?
3. **Mutual targeting:** Important to highlight, or extra complexity?
4. **Animation:** Static arrows or animated (dashed/moving)?
5. **Clutter handling:** Distance-based fading? Max number of arrows shown? Toggle controls?
