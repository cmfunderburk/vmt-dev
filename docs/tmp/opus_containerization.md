## Introduction to Containerization

Containerization is a method of OS-level virtualization that allows you to package an application with all its dependencies, configuration files, libraries, and binaries into a single, portable unit called a container. Unlike traditional virtual machines that virtualize entire operating systems, containers share the host OS kernel while maintaining isolated user spaces.

### The Problem Containerization Solves

Consider the classic developer lament: "But it works on my machine!" This occurs because software depends on a complex stack of components:
- The exact Python version (3.11 in VMT's case)
- System libraries (for pygame's graphics, PyQt5's windowing)
- Environment variables
- File system structure
- Network configurations

Containerization ensures that "your machine" travels with the application.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Container Image**
A read-only template containing instructions for creating a container. Think of it as a snapshot of an entire runtime environment. For VMT, this would include:
- Python 3.11 runtime
- All pip packages (numpy, pygame, PyQt5, pyyaml)
- The VMT codebase
- Configuration files
- Any system-level dependencies pygame/PyQt5 require

### 2. **Container**
A runnable instance of an image. If an image is a class, a container is an object instance. Multiple containers can run from the same image, each with its own writable layer for runtime modifications.

### 3. **Dockerfile**
A text file containing instructions for building a container image. Each instruction creates a layer in the image, enabling efficient caching and distribution.

### 4. **Container Registry**
A repository for storing and distributing container images (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

### 5. **Orchestration**
Tools for managing multiple containers across hosts (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm). Likely overkill for VMT unless you're planning distributed simulations.

## How Containers Work

### The Linux Kernel Foundation

Containers leverage three key Linux kernel features:

1. **Namespaces**: Provide isolated views of system resources
   - PID namespace: Process isolation (container sees its processes as PID 1, 2, 3...)
   - Network namespace: Isolated network stack
   - Mount namespace: Isolated filesystem view
   - User namespace: User/group ID mapping

2. **Control Groups (cgroups)**: Resource allocation and limits
   - CPU shares (limit VMT simulation CPU usage)
   - Memory limits (prevent runaway agent populations from crashing the host)
   - I/O throttling

3. **Union Filesystems**: Layered file system for efficiency
   - Each Dockerfile instruction creates a layer
   - Layers are cached and shared between images
   - Only differences are stored (copy-on-write)

### Runtime Flow

```
1. User runs: docker run vmt-simulation
2. Docker daemon checks for local image
3. Creates container from image layers
4. Sets up namespaces and cgroups
5. Executes entry point (e.g., python main.py)
6. Container runs in isolation
7. Output/logs accessible via docker logs
```

## Docker: The De Facto Standard

Docker has become synonymous with containerization, though alternatives exist (Podman, containerd). Docker provides:

- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that creates and manages containers
- **Docker CLI**: Command-line interface for interaction
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container application definition
- **Docker Desktop**: GUI and simplified setup for Windows/Mac

For VMT, Docker would handle the complexity of:
- Installing Python 3.11 consistently across platforms
- Managing pygame's SDL dependencies
- Handling PyQt5's Qt framework requirements
- Ensuring numpy's BLAS/LAPACK libraries are correctly configured

## Pros and Cons for VMT

### Pros

#### 1. **Deterministic Deployment Environment**
- **Critical for VMT**: Your simulation requires deterministic behavior. Containers ensure identical execution environments, eliminating platform-specific floating-point differences or library variations.
- numpy's linear algebra operations can vary slightly between BLAS implementations; containerization locks this down.

#### 2. **Dependency Management Simplification**
- No more "install pygame on macOS" headaches with SDL2 frameworks
- PyQt5's notorious platform-specific installation issues disappear
- Consistent Python 3.11 without pyenv/conda complexity

#### 3. **Reproducible Research**
- Pin exact versions of all dependencies in the image
- Researchers can reproduce your exact simulation environment years later
- Include the container image hash in publications for perfect reproducibility

#### 4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
- Single image runs identically on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Eliminates "works on Ubuntu but not macOS" issues
- Particularly valuable for GUI components (pygame, PyQt5)

#### 5. **Simplified CI/CD**
- Run tests in the exact production environment
- `pytest` results in CI match local development exactly
- Deploy to any cloud provider without modification

#### 6. **Isolation Benefits**
- VMT's SQLite database writes are contained
- Resource limits prevent runaway simulations from affecting the host
- Clean separation of simulation logs from system logs

#### 7. **Version Management**
- Tag images for different VMT versions (vmt:1.1, vmt:1.2-beta)
- Easy rollback to previous versions
- Side-by-side version testing

### Cons

#### 1. **GUI Complexity**
- **Major Challenge**: Both pygame and PyQt5 require display server access
- X11 forwarding on Linux: Added complexity but doable
- macOS: Requires XQuartz or similar X11 server
- Windows: WSL2 with WSLg or X server setup
- Solution exists but adds configuration burden

#### 2. **Performance Overhead**
- Minimal for CPU-bound operations (1-3% for simulation logic)
- More significant for GPU operations if pygame uses hardware acceleration
- I/O operations slightly slower (SQLite writes, file access)
- Memory overhead: ~100-300MB per container

#### 3. **Development Workflow Changes**
- File editing: Need volume mounts for live code changes
- Debugging: Requires container-aware debugger configuration
- Additional commands: `docker build`, `docker run` vs simple `python main.py`
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Docker

#### 4. **Image Size**
- Base Python: ~100MB
- Add numpy, pygame, PyQt5: Could reach 500MB-1GB
- Distribution/download considerations
- Storage for multiple versions

#### 5. **Platform-Specific Optimizations Lost**
- numpy's MKL optimizations on Intel processors
- Platform-specific SIMD instructions
- Local GPU acceleration (unless using nvidia-docker)

#### 6. **Increased Complexity for Simple Tasks**
- Running `python launcher.py` becomes `docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix vmt launcher.py`
- Environment variable passing
- Volume mounting for scenarios and logs

#### 7. **Windows/macOS Overhead**
- Docker Desktop runs Linux VM (2-4GB RAM overhead)
- Slower file system operations through virtualization layer
- Potential issues with file watching/hot reload

## VMT-Specific Considerations

### 1. **Multiple Entry Points**
VMT has three distinct entry points requiring different configurations:
- `main.py`: Headless CLI mode (easiest to containerize)
- `launcher.py`: Full GUI (requires display server)
- `view_logs.py`: PyQt5 log viewer (also needs display)

**Strategy**: Create multiple Docker targets or use environment variables to switch modes.

### 2. **Determinism Requirements**
Your deterministic simulation benefits greatly from containerization:
- Lock numpy version and BLAS implementation
- Ensure consistent floating-point behavior
- Eliminate platform-specific RNG variations

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- Telemetry SQLite databases need volume mounts
- Scenario YAML files should be mountable
- Log output requires persistent storage

### 4. **Development vs Production**
Consider two image variants:
- **Development**: Includes pytest, debuggers, profilers, volume mounts for code
- **Production**: Minimal image with just runtime requirements

### 5. **GUI Solutions**

**Option A: X11 Forwarding (Linux/Unix)**
```bash
docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
           vmt launcher.py
```

**Option B: VNC Server in Container**
- Run X server inside container
- Access via VNC client or web browser
- More complex but universally compatible

**Option C: Web-Based Interface**
- Long-term: Consider web-based visualization
- Eliminates GUI containerization issues
- Use Flask/FastAPI + JavaScript visualization

## Implementation Strategies

### Minimal Dockerfile Example
```dockerfile
# Start with Python 3.11
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install system dependencies for pygame and PyQt5
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libsdl2-dev \
    libqt5gui5 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Default command (can be overridden)
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Docker Compose for Development
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  vmt-simulation:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./scenarios:/app/scenarios
      - ./logs:/app/logs
      - ./src:/app/src  # For development hot-reload
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=${DISPLAY}
    network_mode: host  # For X11
```

### Progressive Adoption Path
