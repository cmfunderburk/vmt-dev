**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Result**: 8 files → 2 files (75% reduction)

---

## What Was Done

### Created (2 new comprehensive files)

1. **`docs/guides/money_system.md`** (868 lines)
   - Complete user guide (educators & users)
   - Developer reference (architecture, API, testing)
   - Implementation status (Phases 1-4 complete, 5-6 deferred)
   - Detailed specifications (control flow, tie-breaking, telemetry)
   - Appendices (design decisions, future extensions)

2. **`docs/implementation/money_system_tracker.md`** (270 lines)
   - Live status dashboard (Phases 1-4 complete)
   - Completion dates and git commits for each phase
   - Deferred phases (5-6) with rationale
   - Decision gates for next steps
   - Metrics & achievements

### Deleted (8 fragmented files from BIG/)

1. `money_SSOT_implementation_plan.md` (475 lines) → Consolidated
2. `money_implementation_strategy.md` (263 lines) → Consolidated
3. `money_phase3_checklist.md` → Obsolete (Phase 3 complete)
4. `money_phase4_checklist.md` → Obsolete (Phase 4 complete)
5. `money_phase5_checklist.md` → Info in tracker
6. `money_phase6_checklist.md` → Info in tracker
7. `PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` → Git history (commit ff3c323)
8. `PHASE2_PR_DESCRIPTION.md` → Git history (commit 42d7333)
9. `money_telemetry_schema.md` → Redundant with 4_typing_overview.md

**Note**: `docs/BIG/` directory now empty and can be removed.

### Updated

- **`docs/quick_reference.md`** — Updated all money-related links to point to new locations

---

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Navigation Friction Eliminated

**Before:**
To understand "What is Money Phase 4?", users needed to read:
1. `money_SSOT_implementation_plan.md` (overview)
2. `money_implementation_strategy.md` (two-track context)
3. `money_phase4_checklist.md` (details)
4. `quick_reference.md` (phase number reconciliation)

**After:**
Single source of truth: `docs/guides/money_system.md`

### 2. Maintenance Burden Reduced

**Before:** 8 files to update for any money system change  
**After:** 2 files (guide + tracker)

### 3. Information Completeness

**Single guide contains:**
- User guide for educators
- Developer architecture reference
- Implementation status (current: v1.0 complete)
- Detailed specifications
- Design decisions
- Future extensions

### 4. Status Clarity

**Tracker explicitly shows:**
- ✅ Phases 1-4: COMPLETE (with dates and git commits)
- ⏸️ Phases 5-6: DEFERRED per ADR-001 (with rationale)
