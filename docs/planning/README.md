# VMT Project Planning

**Status**: Active

This directory contains the strategic vision, roadmap, and detailed implementation plans for the VMT project.

## Document Structure

- **[0_VMT_Roadmap.md](./0_VMT_Roadmap.md)**: The master document. It contains the high-level vision, core architecture, and a summary of the implementation roadmap. Start here to understand the project's goals and current status.

- **`1_Implementation_Stage*.md`**: These files contain the detailed, pseudocode-level implementation plans for each upcoming stage of the project. They are the tactical blueprints for developers.

- **`reference/`**: Contains foundational theoretical documents and knowledge bases that inform the project's design but are not tied to a specific implementation stage.

- **`archive/`**: (deleted from repo -- can find in git history if needed) Contains all previous planning documents, including the original `opus_plan` and `CURRENT` implementation details for completed stages. This serves as a historical record of the project's evolution.
