# BIGGEST_PICTURE Documentation

**Purpose:** Strategic vision and high-level architecture documentation

---

## What This Directory Contains

This directory holds **strategic, enduring documentation** that captures:
- The fundamental vision and research questions
- Economic and pedagogical philosophy
- High-level architecture (conceptual, not implementation)
- Long-term research agenda
- **Quick reorientation guides for getting back up to speed**

**These documents are:**
- ‚úÖ Code-agnostic (concepts, not implementation) 
- ‚úÖ Stable (updated infrequently, only for major direction changes)
- ‚úÖ Strategic (the "why" and "what", not the "how")
- ‚úÖ Accessible (readable by non-programmers: economists, educators, collaborators)
- ‚úÖ **Actionable** (new: includes reorientation guides with clear next steps)

**These documents are NOT:**
- ‚ùå Implementation guides (see `docs/protocols_10-27/`)
- ‚ùå Living/evolving plans (see `docs/ASDF/SESSION_STATE.md`)
- ‚ùå Code documentation (see source code docstrings)
- ‚ùå Technical manuals (see `docs/2_technical_manual.md`)

## Current Documents

### üöÄ [`CURRENT_STATE_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`](CURRENT_STATE_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md) **START HERE**

**Your 5-minute reorientation guide** when you're lost in the complexity:

1. **Where You Are** ‚Äî Quick summary of what's working and what you just completed
2. **Exact Roadmap Position** ‚Äî Shows you're at Phase 2a, ready to implement Random Walk Search  
3. **Next Implementation** ‚Äî Complete specification with template code for your next 2-3 hours
4. **Development Checklist** ‚Äî Step-by-step tasks for Phase 2a (8-10 hours total)
5. **Success Metrics** ‚Äî How to know when you've succeeded

**Read this when:**
- ‚úì Starting a new session and feeling lost
- ‚úì Need to remember where you left off
- ‚úì Want clear, actionable next steps
- ‚úì Need template code to start from

### [`vision_and_architecture.md`](vision_and_architecture.md)

**The master strategic document** covering:

1. **The Fundamental Question**
   - Why standard economics pedagogy is limiting
   - VMT's alternative: markets as emergent phenomena

2. **Core Design Philosophy**
   - Markets don't just happen‚Äîthey emerge from institutions
   - Institutional comparative analysis as research program
   - Spatial and temporal dynamics matter

3. **Economic Foundations**
   - Basic exchange economy structure
   - From utility to prices: the emergence question

4. **Protocol Categories**
   - Search, Matching, Bargaining, Market Mechanisms
   - Economic and pedagogical value of each

5. **Current State**
   - What exists and works
   - What's possible now
   - What's missing for full vision

6. **Research Agenda**
   - Protocol development phases (2a through 5)
   - Key research themes and questions
   - Phase 3 as critical milestone

7. **Pedagogical Applications**
   - Rethinking intermediate micro
   - Teaching markets as constructions

8. **Future Extensions**
   - Production economies
   - Public goods and externalities
   - Asymmetric information
   - Network formation

9. **Long-Term Vision**
   - 3-5 year roadmap
   - Ultimate goals

**Read this to understand:**
- What VMT is trying to accomplish and why
- The research questions driving development
- How protocols connect to economic theory
- Long-term vision and priorities

## When to Update These Documents

### Rarely (Major Changes Only)

Update `vision_and_architecture.md` when:
- ‚úì Fundamental research questions change
- ‚úì Major strategic pivots occur
- ‚úì Long-term vision shifts significantly
- ‚úì After major milestones (e.g., Phase 3 completion)

**Do NOT update for:**
- ‚úó Implementation details
- ‚úó Protocol completion (that's in ASDF or ssot)
- ‚úó Bug fixes or refactoring
- ‚úó Session-to-session progress
