# Rethinking the Vision

## Launcher Entrypoint


Running python launcher.py should open a GUI that looks as follows:

|-----------------|
|   Agent-Based   | 
|-----------------| 
|   Game Theory   |
|-----------------|
|Standard Neoclassical| 
|-----------------|

Each of these should be buttons.

Selecting the Agent-Based Sim should open to the current scenario selection GUI.
Selecting Game Theory should open a new GUI which will be populated more in the future, but for now should have Bargaining Protocols as a button, which will serve as the entrypoint for the Edgeworth Box/2-agent (or small N generally, where "small" needs to be figured out based on experience as I build it out) bargaining protocol project, allowing a different simulation interface than the current main VMT sim that will be designed explicitly for visualizing things like the Edgeworth Box, individual utilities, inventories, trades, etc.
Selecting Standard Neoclassical will open a new GUI window, with options like "Walrasian Auctioneer" and other standard equilibrium models that will also be built in a different presentation from the agent-based sim.

## Game Theory

The textbooks that I'd like to follow for this module are:
(1) David Kreps' Microeconomic Foundations II
(2) Osborne&Rubinstein A Course in Game Theory

## Standard Neoclassical

The two textbooks that I'd like to follow for this module are:
    (1) Jehle&Reny Advanced Microeconomic Theory
    (2) David Kreps' Microeconomic Foundations I
