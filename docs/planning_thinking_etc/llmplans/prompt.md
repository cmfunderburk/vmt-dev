For context: @new_vision_nov_1_llm_input.md and @initial_planning (ORIGINAL).md . Prompt:

The new_vision file represents an expansion of the vmt-dev project vision documentation to be more in line with my initial way of thinking (as documented in inital_planning (ORIGINAL), but with the agent-based simulation incorporated directly into the foundation.

Help me brainstorm further planning -- I need to build out a plan to implement the standard neoclassical theory track. For example,

- thinking through Jehle&Reny chapter presentation: how to  present this to users in the GUI, and then how to build out the backend framework to do the calculations and prepare the visualizations.

- thinking through proper pedagogical presentation of Game Theory modules. Beginning with bargaining would have direct crossover to the existing agent-based simulation via allowing more indepth understanding of implemented/planned protocols, but the standard approaches e.g. in Kreps or Osborne/Rubinstein have different starting points.

I'm in the early stages of thinking through and planning this. Create a comprehensive markdown document brainstorming resolutions to these and related problems.
