# VMT Single Source of Truth Documentation

**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Purpose:** Consolidated, authoritative plans for VMT architectural initiatives  

---

## Overview

This directory contains the single source of truth documentation consolidating multiple proposals and plans for the VMT project. These documents supersede the individual proposals in `docs/proposals/`.

---

## Document Structure

### 1. üìã [decision_points.md](decision_points.md) - **START HERE**
Critical decisions that need your input before implementation can proceed.

**Key Decisions:**
- Implementation approach (full vs minimal)
- Technical architecture choices
- Priority and resource allocation

**Action Required:** Review and provide answers to decision points.

### 2. üó∫Ô∏è [implementation_roadmap.md](implementation_roadmap.md)
Prioritized roadmap showing how all initiatives relate and their sequencing.

**Contents:**
- Priority matrix
- 12-week implementation timeline
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics

### 3. üèóÔ∏è [protocol_modularization_master_plan.md](protocol_modularization_master_plan.md)
Comprehensive technical plan for the protocol modularization initiative.

**Contents:**
- Architectural vision (7-phase decomposition)
- Core contracts (WorldView, Effects)
- Implementation phases
- Testing strategy

### 4. üì¶ [utility_modularization_plan.md](utility_modularization_plan.md)  
Separate plan for refactoring the utility.py module.

**Contents:**
- Phase 1: Base extraction (2 hours)
- Phase 2: Full modularization (optional)
- Backward compatibility guarantee

### 5. üß™ [testing_validation_strategy.md](testing_validation_strategy.md)
Comprehensive testing approach for all refactoring work.

**Contents:**
- Test principles and requirements
- Phase-specific test plans
- Performance benchmarks
- CI/CD integration

### 6. üìö [developer_onboarding_integration.md](developer_onboarding_integration.md)
Plan for updating the developer onboarding program.

**Contents:**
- Required module updates
- New exercises and materials
- Timeline for updates

## Quick Navigation Guide

### If you need to make a decision:
1. Read [decision_points.md](decision_points.md)
2. Fill out the Decision Summary Form
3. Reply with your choices

### If you want the big picture:
1. Read [implementation_roadmap.md](implementation_roadmap.md)
2. Review the priority matrix and timeline

### If you want technical details:
1. Read [protocol_modularization_master_plan.md](protocol_modularization_master_plan.md)
2. Focus on Parts I-III for architecture
3. Review Part IV for testing approach

### If you want quick wins:
1. Read [utility_modularization_plan.md](utility_modularization_plan.md) Phase 1
2. This can be done in 2 hours with immediate benefits

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Utility Base Extraction** (2 hours)
   - Zero risk, immediate value
   - See [utility_modularization_plan.md](utility_modularization_plan.md) Phase 1

2. **Protocol Decision** 
   - Choose full vs minimal implementation
   - See [decision_points.md](decision_points.md) Question 1

### Primary Initiative (Next 12 Weeks)

**Protocol Modularization**
- Critical for Phase C features
- 12-week timeline
- See [protocol_modularization_master_plan.md](protocol_modularization_master_plan.md)

### Secondary Initiatives (Parallel/Later)

1. **Full Utility Modularization** (optional)
   - Can assign to new developer
   - See [utility_modularization_plan.md](utility_modularization_plan.md) Phase 2

2. **Onboarding Updates**
   - After protocols complete
   - See [developer_onboarding_integration.md](developer_onboarding_integration.md)

## Relationship to Original Proposals

These documents consolidate and supersede:
- `docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_plan_v3.md`
- `docs/proposals/protocol_modularization_implementation_guide.md`
- `docs/proposals/quickreview.md`
- `docs/proposals/session_reentry_protocol_modularization.md`
- `docs/proposals/utility_modularization_proposal.md`
- `docs/proposals/developer_onboarding_program.md`

The original proposals remain for reference but this directory contains the authoritative versions.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** [decision_points.md](decision_points.md)
2. **Decide** on implementation approach
3. **Approve** to proceed
4. **Begin** with utility base extraction (quick win)
5. **Start** protocol Phase 0 if approved
