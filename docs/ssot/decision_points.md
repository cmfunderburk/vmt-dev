## IMMEDIATE DECISIONS (This Week)

### 1. Overall Implementation Approach

**Question:** How should we proceed with protocol modularization?

**Option A: Full Implementation (Recommended)**
- 12-week comprehensive refactoring
- All protocols implemented
- Complete documentation
- **Pros:** Unblocks all Phase C features, research-grade system
- **Cons:** 3-month timeline, significant effort

**Option B: Minimal Implementation**
- 4-week infrastructure only
- Legacy adapters only (no new features)
- Extensible foundation
- **Pros:** Lower risk, faster delivery
- **Cons:** No immediate research value

**Option C: Defer Protocol Work**
- Focus on other priorities
- Continue with monolithic system
- **Pros:** No effort required
- **Cons:** Cannot implement Phase C features

**➤ DECISION NEEDED:** _______________________

### 2. Utility Base Extraction

**Question:** Should we immediately extract the Utility ABC to base.py?

- **Effort:** 2 hours
- **Risk:** Very Low
- **Benefit:** Cleaner code structure immediately

**Recommendation:** Yes - proceed immediately

**➤ DECISION:** ⬜ Yes | ⬜ No

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (Week 1)

### 3. Effect Application Strategy

**Question:** How should protocols apply their effects?

**Option A: Immediate Application (Recommended)**
```python
def execute_phase(self):
    effects = protocol.generate_effects()
    for effect in effects:
        self.apply_effect(effect)  # Applied immediately
```
- **Pros:** Simpler, easier debugging
- **Cons:** Less parallelizable

**Option B: Batch Application**
```python
def execute_phase(self):
    all_effects = []
    for protocol in protocols:
        all_effects.extend(protocol.generate_effects())
    self.apply_all_effects(all_effects)  # Applied at end
```
- **Pros:** Better for future parallelization
- **Cons:** Complex conflict resolution

**➤ DECISION NEEDED:** _______________________

### 4. Multi-tick State Storage

**Question:** How should protocols store state across ticks?

**Option A: Effect-based State (Recommended)**
```python
InternalStateUpdate(
    protocol_name="rubinstein",
    agent_id=0,
    key="round_number",
    value=3
)
```
- **Pros:** Full audit trail, reproducible
- **Cons:** More telemetry overhead

**Option B: Protocol-managed State**
```python
class RubinsteinProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}  # Protocol owns state
```
- **Pros:** Less telemetry overhead
- **Cons:** Harder to debug, reproduce

**➤ DECISION NEEDED:** _______________________

### 5. Protocol Versioning Scheme

**Question:** How should we version individual protocols?

**Option A: Semantic Versioning (Recommended)**
- Format: `major.minor.patch` (e.g., "1.0.0")
- Clear compatibility rules
- Industry standard

**Option B: Date-based Versioning**
- Format: `YYYY.MM.DD` (e.g., "2025.01.27")
- Matches current VMT practice
- Simpler for research

**Option C: Simple Integers**
- Format: `v1`, `v2`, `v3`
- Simplest approach
- Less information

**➤ DECISION NEEDED:** _______________________

## PRIORITY DECISIONS (Week 2)

### 6. First Alternative Protocols

**Question:** After legacy adapters, which protocols should we implement first?

**Research Focus Options:**

**Option A: Bargaining Mechanisms**
- Take-it-or-leave-it
- Rubinstein alternating offers
- Nash bargaining
- **Use Case:** Test bargaining power theories

**Option B: Search/Matching Algorithms**  
- Random walk search
- Memory-based search
- Greedy matching
- **Use Case:** Test information/learning theories

**Option C: Phase C Preparation**
- Posted-price markets
- Sealed-bid auctions
- Market makers
- **Use Case:** Prepare for market mechanisms

**➤ PREFERENCE:** _______________________

### 7. Performance Targets

**Question:** What performance regression is acceptable?

**Current Performance:**
- 100 agents: ~12 ticks/second
- 20 agents: ~125 ticks/second
- 3 agents: ~485 ticks/second

**Options:**
- ⬜ <5% regression (may limit features)
- ⬜ <10% regression (recommended)
- ⬜ <20% regression (more flexibility)

**➤ DECISION NEEDED:** _______________________

## RESOURCE DECISIONS

### 8. Development Allocation

**Question:** How should development effort be allocated?

**Option A: Dedicated Push**
- One developer, full-time for 12 weeks
- Faster completion
- Consistent architecture

**Option B: Part-time Development**
- 50% allocation over 24 weeks
- Allows parallel work
- Longer timeline

**Option C: Team Effort**
- Multiple developers
- Requires more coordination
- Risk of inconsistency

**➤ APPROACH:** _______________________

### 9. Testing Strategy

**Question:** What level of testing is required?

**Minimum (Required):**
- All existing tests pass
- Telemetry backward compatible
- Basic property tests

**Recommended:**
- Above plus:
- Golden standard tests
- Property-based testing
- Economic validation
- Performance benchmarks

**Comprehensive:**
- Above plus:
- Comparative analysis
- Multi-protocol scenarios
- Formal verification

**➤ LEVEL:** _______________________

## OPTIONAL DECISIONS

### 10. Utility Modularization (Phase 2)

**Question:** When should we do full utility modularization?

- ⬜ After protocol modularization
- ⬜ Assign to new developer
- ⬜ Defer indefinitely

**Recommendation:** Assign to new developer

### 11. Developer Onboarding Updates

**Question:** When should we update onboarding materials?

- ⬜ During protocol implementation
- ⬜ After protocols complete
- ⬜ As separate project

**Recommendation:** After protocols complete

### 12. GUI Integration

**Question:** How should protocol selection work in GUI?

- ⬜ Dropdown menu per protocol type
- ⬜ Advanced settings dialog
- ⬜ Config file only initially

**Recommendation:** Dropdown menu
