# Implementation Plans

This directory contains **active implementation plans** for approved features currently in development or ready to be implemented.

## Active Plans

### Scenario Generator
- **[Phase 2 Plan](scenario_generator_phase2_plan.md)** - Exchange regimes and presets
- **[Status Document](scenario_generator_status.md)** - Current progress and next steps

## Plan Lifecycle

Plans move through these states:
1. **Ready** → Approved for implementation, detailed plan written
2. **In Progress** → Currently being implemented
3. **Complete** → Implementation finished, move to `docs/archive/`

## Completion

When an implementation plan is complete:
1. Create completion summary (see `docs/BIG/PHASE*_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` for examples)
2. Move plan and completion summary to `docs/archive/`
3. Update main documentation with new features
4. Reference ADR if significant decisions were made
