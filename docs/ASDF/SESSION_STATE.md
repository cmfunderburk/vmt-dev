## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Test count verification needed**
  - Claimed: "316+ tests passing"
  - Actual: 37 test files, ~166 test functions found in grep
  - Action: Run `pytest --collect-only` to verify actual count
  - Update: `.cursor/rules/vmt-development-workflow.mdc` with accurate number

- [ ] **Monolithic DecisionSystem** (Priority: High)
  - File: `src/vmt_engine/systems/decision.py` (~600 lines)
  - Problem: Hard to extend, blocks Phase C features
  - Solution: Protocol modularization (DEC-001 pending)
  - Timeline: 4-12 weeks depending on approach

- [ ] **Utility.py size** (Priority: Low)
  - File: `src/vmt_engine/econ/utility.py` (744 lines)
  - Problem: Mixed abstraction levels (interface + implementations)
  - Solution: Phase 1 extraction approved (DEC-002)
  - Timeline: 2 hours

### Documentation
- [ ] **Documentation sprawl** (Priority: Medium)
  - Problem: `docs/proposals/` contains superseded content
  - Superseded: `protocol_modularization_plan_v*.md`, `session_reentry_*.md`
  - Current: `docs/ssot/` is authoritative
  - Solution: Consolidation task in workflow proposals (2 hours)

- [ ] **Stale metadata** (Priority: Low)
  - Kernel version in rules: 6.17.4 → 6.17.5 (current)
  - Test count claims need verification
  - Solution: Periodic metadata refresh task

### Architectural
- [ ] **Protocol modularization decision pending** (Priority: Critical)
  - Blocks: Phase C market mechanisms
  - Blocks: Advanced bargaining protocols
  - Blocks: Comparative institutional analysis
  - Decision: DEC-001 (Full vs Minimal vs Defer)

## AI Agent Notes

### Decision Authority (Until rules finalized)

**GREEN LIGHT (Proceed Immediately):**
- Reading codebase/documentation
- Running tests (`pytest`)
- Code formatting (`black`, `ruff`)
- Fixing linter errors
- Adding docstrings/comments
- Updating this SESSION_STATE.md
- Creating draft proposals
- Utility base extraction (DEC-002 approved)
- Documentation consolidation (approved in workflow review)

**YELLOW LIGHT (Propose, then wait for approval):**
- Protocol modularization work (DEC-001 pending)
- Modifying core simulation logic
- Adding/removing dependencies
- Performance optimizations
- Major refactoring (>100 lines)

**RED LIGHT (Always defer to user):**
- Architectural decisions (effect system, versioning, state storage)
- Resource allocation (12-week vs 4-week plans)
- Research priorities (which protocols first)
- Breaking changes
- Git force operations

### Current Session Context

**Token Usage:** ~60k / 1M tokens used (6%)  
**Context Status:** Healthy, no handoff needed yet  
**Files Read:** ~15 key files (docs/ssot/, rules/, core engine)  
**Findings:** See comprehensive review in this session  

**Key Insights from Review:**
1. Project at complexity inflection point (medium research-grade codebase)
2. Documentation well-organized but sprawling (proposals vs ssot)
3. Core architecture solid (7-phase determinism, comprehensive telemetry)
4. Test coverage good but metrics need verification
5. Workflow friction predictable for project at this scale

**Recommended Focus:**
- Workflow improvements BEFORE major architectural changes
- Small wins (utility extraction) to test new workflow
- Then tackle protocol modularization with better infrastructure

## Notes & Context

### Why Protocol Modularization Matters
- **Current:** Monolithic DecisionSystem (~600 lines) hard-codes three-pass pairing
- **Problem:** Cannot implement Phase C features (posted-price markets, auctions)
- **Solution:** Protocol architecture with swappable search/matching/bargaining
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks (minimal) or 12 weeks (full) depending on approach
- **Status:** Planning complete, awaiting decision to proceed

### Why Workflow Improvements Matter
- **Current:** No session state tracking, documentation sprawl, unclear AI authority
- **Problem:** Context switching cost high, decision rationale lost, AI asks too much
- **Solution:** SESSION_STATE.md, DECISIONS.md, Agent Authority rules, consolidation
- **Timeline:** 5-9 hours total (Tier 1-2)
- **Status:** In progress (this file is first deliverable)

### Project Philosophy
- **Determinism First:** Reproducibility is non-negotiable (PCG64 seeding, sorted iteration)
- **Pedagogical Focus:** Performance at N=100 agents, not N=10,000
- **Research Grade:** Comprehensive telemetry, multiple utility functions, economic rigor
- **Solo Development:** Pragmatic trade-offs, documentation over process
