# Phase 1 Implementation Review Guide

**Status:** Implementation complete, but behavioral verification failing
**Branch:** `protocol_phase1`
**Last Session:** Previous computer, documented in `phase1state.md`

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Protocol Infrastructure (NEW)

All files created in `src/vmt_engine/protocols/`:

- **`base.py`** - Base protocol classes and Effect types
- **`context.py`** - WorldView, ProtocolContext data structures
- **`context_builders.py`** - Helper functions to build WorldView/ProtocolContext
- **`registry.py`** - Protocol registration system
- **`telemetry_schema.py`** - Telemetry schema definitions

### 2. Three Legacy Protocols (NEW)

Extract-and-refactor approach: logic extracted from systems into protocols.

#### `protocols/search/legacy.py` - LegacySearchProtocol
- **Extracted from:** `DecisionSystem._evaluate_trade_preferences()`, `_evaluate_forage_target()`, `_evaluate_trade_vs_forage()`
- **Methods:**
  - `build_preferences()` - Build ranked preference list
  - `select_target()` - Mode-aware target selection
- **Returns:** `SetTarget`, `ClaimResource`, `InternalStateUpdate` effects

#### `protocols/matching/legacy.py` - LegacyMatchingProtocol
- **Extracted from:** `DecisionSystem._pass2_mutual_consent()`, `_pass3_best_available_fallback()`, `_pass3b_handle_unpaired_trade_targets()`
- **Methods:**
  - `find_matches()` - Three-pass matching algorithm
- **Returns:** `Pair`, `Unpair` effects

#### `protocols/bargaining/legacy.py` - LegacyBargainingProtocol
- **Extracted from:** `TradeSystem._trade_generic()` and compensating block logic
- **Methods:**
  - `negotiate()` - Find compensating block trade
- **Returns:** `Trade`, `Unpair` effects

### 3. Refactored Systems (MODIFIED)

#### `systems/decision.py` - DecisionSystem
- **Before:** 544 lines with embedded search/matching logic
- **After:** 317 lines (-42%), orchestrator pattern
- **Changes:**
  - Protocols injected via `search_protocol`, `matching_protocol` fields
  - `execute()` now calls protocols and applies effects
  - Logic extraction: search/matching moved to protocols
  - Kept: housekeeping utilities, telemetry logging

#### `systems/trading.py` - TradeSystem
- **Before:** 406 lines with embedded bargaining logic
- **After:** 202 lines (-50%), orchestrator pattern
- **Changes:**
  - Protocol injected via `bargaining_protocol` field
  - `execute()` calls protocol and applies effects
  - Logic extraction: trade negotiation moved to protocol
  - Kept: pair enumeration, effect application

### 4. Integration (MODIFIED)

#### `simulation.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added protocol initialization in `__init__()` (defaults to legacy protocols)
  - Protocol injection into DecisionSystem and TradeSystem
  - Backward compatible: no scenario changes required

## Critical Issue Found

**Problem:** Tests failing - no trades occurring in foundational barter demo (expected ≥1, got 0)

**What works:**
- ✅ All code compiles without linter errors
- ✅ Protocol implementations complete
- ✅ Context builders implemented
- ✅ Systems refactored to orchestrators
- ✅ Integration complete

**What's broken:**
- ❌ Search → Matching → Trade pipeline not producing trades
- ❌ Behavioral equivalence verification failing

**Possible causes:**
1. Search protocol not setting trade targets correctly
2. Matching protocol not finding pairs (preference format issue?)
3. Bargaining protocol not being called or failing silently
4. Effect application has subtle bugs
5. Context builders missing critical state

## Files to Review

### Priority 1: Core Protocol Logic
1. **[protocols/search/legacy.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/protocols/search/legacy.py)** (277 lines)
   - Check: Target selection logic, especially trade vs forage
   - Check: Effect emission for SetTarget

2. **[protocols/matching/legacy.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/protocols/matching/legacy.py)** (258 lines)
   - Check: Preference list format expected vs received
   - Check: Three-pass algorithm, especially Pass 2 mutual consent

3. **[protocols/bargaining/legacy.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/protocols/bargaining/legacy.py)** (204 lines)
   - Check: Distance check before negotiation
   - Check: Compensating block search logic

### Priority 2: Context Building
4. **[protocols/context_builders.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/protocols/context_builders.py)** (196 lines)
   - Check: WorldView construction from perception cache
   - Check: All required fields populated (quotes, cooldowns, etc.)

### Priority 3: Orchestrators
5. **[systems/decision.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/systems/decision.py)** (317 lines)
   - Check: Effect application logic
   - Check: Preference passing to matching phase

6. **[systems/trading.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/systems/trading.py)** (202 lines)
   - Check: Protocol call and effect application
   - Check: Pair enumeration

### Priority 4: Integration
7. **[simulation.py](mdc:src/vmt_engine/simulation.py)** (lines 276-310 approximately)
   - Check: Protocol initialization and injection

## Suggested Review Process

### Step 1: Read Protocol Base Classes
```bash
# Understand the Effect types and protocol interfaces
cat src/vmt_engine/protocols/base.py
cat src/vmt_engine/protocols/context.py
```

### Step 2: Review Context Builders
```bash
# Check how WorldView is built from simulation state
cat src/vmt_engine/protocols/context_builders.py
```

### Step 3: Trace Through One Protocol
Pick **LegacySearchProtocol** as it's the entry point:
```bash
cat src/vmt_engine/protocols/search/legacy.py
```

Questions to answer:
- Does `build_preferences()` correctly rank trade targets?
- Does `select_target()` emit proper `SetTarget` effects?
- Are trade targets getting stored on agents?

### Step 4: Check Orchestrator Integration
```bash
cat src/vmt_engine/systems/decision.py
```

Questions:
- Is `_execute_search_phase()` calling protocol correctly?
- Is `_apply_search_effects()` updating agent state?
- Are preferences being passed to matching phase?

### Step 5: Run Minimal Test
```bash
cd /home/cmf/Work/vmt-dev && source venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/test_barter_integration.py::test_three_agent_foundational_barter -xvs
```

This will show the exact failure point.

## Key Design Decisions (Confirmed)

From phase1state.md, these were your decisions:

1. **WorldView overhead:** Accept it (simpler, cleaner)
2. **Effect timing:** Immediate application (matches DEC-003)
3. **Resource claiming:** Option C (ClaimResource effects)
4. **Preference storage:** Option B (DecisionSystem stores dict)
5. **Trade cooldowns:** Passed via WorldView, checked in matching

## Questions for Review

Before debugging, please consider:

1. **Architecture:** Does the extract-and-refactor approach make sense after seeing the code?
2. **Effect types:** Are the Effect classes sufficient? Missing any state updates?
3. **Context completeness:** Does WorldView capture all needed state from perception cache?
4. **Testing approach:** Should we add detailed logging to trace the pipeline?
5. **Rollback vs Fix:** Worth fixing, or should we reconsider the approach?

## Next Steps (After Your Review)

Once you've reviewed and identified issues:

1. **If minor bugs:** Add detailed logging, trace pipeline, fix bugs
2. **If architectural issue:** Discuss redesign before proceeding
3. **If unclear:** Add unit tests for individual protocols to isolate failures

**Ready when you are.** Take your time reviewing - this is a major refactoring and getting it right matters more than speed.
