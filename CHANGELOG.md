## [Unreleased]

### Removed - BREAKING CHANGE
- **Summary Logging Level Removed** (2025-10-19): Removed `LogLevel.SUMMARY` and `LogConfig.summary()` from telemetry system based on performance benchmark evidence showing minimal benefit (<3% in exchange scenarios) while removing valuable decision data.
  - **Breaking**: Code using `LogConfig.summary()` will raise `AttributeError`
  - **Breaking**: Code using `LogLevel.SUMMARY` will raise `AttributeError`
  - **Breaking**: CLI argument `--log-level summary` will raise `argparse` error
  - **Migration**: Replace all `LogConfig.summary()` with `LogConfig.standard()`
  - **Rationale**: Performance benchmarks showed summary logging (4.0 TPS) was actually slower than standard logging (4.1 TPS) in exchange scenarios. Trade logging dominates overhead regardless of level. Comprehensive logging is vital for pedagogical and research use.
  - **Remaining levels**: STANDARD (default, comprehensive production logging) and DEBUG (adds failed trade attempt logging)
  - **See**: `docs/PLAN_remove_summary_logging.md` for full implementation details

### Removed
- **Unused CSV Config Fields** (2025-10-19): Removed `export_csv` and `csv_dir` fields from `LogConfig` dataclass in `src/telemetry/config.py`
  - **Non-breaking**: These fields were never used in the codebase; they were placeholders for automatic CSV export during simulation
  - **Note**: CSV export functionality remains available via the log viewer GUI (`src/vmt_log_viewer/csv_export.py`)
  - **Rationale**: Simplifies configuration by removing dead code; automatic CSV export during simulation is not currently a planned feature

### Changed
- **Telemetry Configuration Simplified** (2025-10-19): `LogLevel` enum renumbered (STANDARD=1, DEBUG=2) and `__post_init__` logic simplified to only handle DEBUG level configuration

### Fixed
- Nothing yet

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Corrected misleading documentation in the GUI Scenario Builder. The text now accurately describes that the "Utility Mix" feature creates a heterogeneous agent population by assigning a single utility function to each agent from a weighted random distribution, rather than creating agents with mixed utility functions. (`src/vmt_launcher/scenario_builder.py`)

### Changed
- Improved and clarified documentation in the user-facing `docs/1_project_overview.md` and the developer-focused `docs/2_technical_manual.md` to formally describe the probabilistic assignment of utility functions.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added - GUI Launcher & Scenario Builder
- **GUI Launcher**: Added a PyQt5-based GUI (`launcher.py`) for browsing, selecting, and running scenarios with a specified seed.
- **Scenario Builder**: Implemented a comprehensive, tabbed GUI dialog for creating and saving custom `.yaml` scenarios from scratch, eliminating the need for manual YAML editing.
- **Input Validation**: Added a robust validator to the scenario builder to provide real-time feedback and prevent the creation of invalid scenarios.
- **In-Context Documentation**: Embedded a rich HTML documentation panel directly into the scenario builder's "Utility Functions" tab to explain economic concepts and parameters.

### Added - SQLite Telemetry System Overhaul
- **Database Backend**: Replaced the entire CSV-based logging system with a SQLite backend.
- **Interactive Log Viewer**: Created a new standalone PyQt5 application (`view_logs.py`) for interactively exploring simulation data. Features include a timeline scrubber, detailed agent state analysis, trade history, and CSV export functionality.
- **Structured Logging**: Implemented multiple log levels (SUMMARY, STANDARD, DEBUG) and a structured database schema to capture detailed information about agent states, trades, decisions, and resources.

### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Refactored the project into a `src/` layout for better organization and scalability.
- **Dependencies**: Added `PyQt5` to `requirements.txt`.
- **Documentation**: Overhauled the `docs/` folder, consolidating planning documents and creating the `1_project_overview.md`, `2_technical_manual.md`, and `3_strategic_roadmap.md` as the new single sources of truth.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added - Core Simulation Engine
- **Agent-Based Model**: Initial implementation of a spatial agent-based simulation on a 2D grid.
- **Economic Utility**: Core economic modeling with CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) and Linear utility functions.
- **Barter Trading System**: Agents can engage in bilateral barter. Implemented a sophisticated price search algorithm to find mutually beneficial integer block trades (`Î”U > 0` for both parties).
- **Reservation Pricing**: Agent quotes (bids/asks) are derived from true reservation prices based on their Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS), with a "zero-inventory guard" for robustness.
- **Behavioral Systems**: Implemented core agent behaviors including distance-discounted foraging, resource regeneration with cooldowns, and a trade cooldown system to prevent futile negotiations.
- **Determinism**: Ensured the simulation is fully deterministic; a given scenario and seed will always produce identical outcomes.
- **Initial Telemetry**: Created the first-generation telemetry system, logging simulation data to a set of CSV files (`trades.csv`, `agent_snapshots.csv`, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Implemented a real-time `Pygame` visualization window with interactive controls (pause, step, reset, quit).
- **Configuration**: Scenarios are defined via flexible `YAML` configuration files.
- **Testing**: Established a comprehensive test suite with over 45 tests covering all core systems.
