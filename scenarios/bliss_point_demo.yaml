# Expected behaviors:
# - Agents below bliss (e.g., A=5, B=5) will seek to acquire goods
# - Agents at bliss (e.g., A=10, B=10) will refuse trades (MU=0)
# - Agents above bliss (e.g., A=15, B=15) may want to give away excess (negative MU)
# - Cross-curvature gamma=0.2 creates weak complementarity
# - Observe agents clustering around bliss point over time
