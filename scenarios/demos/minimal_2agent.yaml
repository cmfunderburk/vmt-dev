# Expected Outcome:
# - Agents start at random positions
# - Both have high utility from trade (A-rich wants B, B-rich wants A)
# - Within 3-5 ticks: agents move adjacent
# - First trade: ~3A for ~3B (depending on exact MRS)
# - Result: More balanced inventories, higher utility for both
# - Total trades: 1-2 (small grid, simple setup)
