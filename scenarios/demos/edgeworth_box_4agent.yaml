# Classic Edgeworth Box: 2 agent types with complementary endowments
# Type 1 (agents 0,1): A-rich → want B
# Type 2 (agents 2,3): B-rich → want A
initial_inventories:
  A: [10, 10, 3, 3]   # Type 1: lots of A, Type 2: little A
  B: [3, 3, 10, 10]   # Type 1: little B, Type 2: lots of B

# All agents have same CES utility (ρ = 0.5, complementary goods)
# This creates strong gains from trade

# Expected Outcome:
# 1. Initial State:
#    - Type 1 agents: U ≈ 4.8 (√(10*3) with CES)
#    - Type 2 agents: U ≈ 4.8 (√(3*10) with CES)
#
# 2. Trading Pattern:
#    - Type 1 trades A for B with Type 2
#    - Type 2 trades B for A with Type 1
#    - Multiple trades (3-6 total)
#
# 3. Convergence (~10-15 ticks):
#    - Inventories approach balanced (6-7 each of A and B)
#    - Utility increases to ~6.5 per agent
#    - Pareto improvement: total welfare +35%
#
# 4. Classic Edgeworth Box Result:
#    - Movement along contract curve
#    - Core allocation (no further mutually beneficial trades)
#    - Demonstrates gains from trade
