# Demo 2: Barter vs Money (Comparison Template)
#
# Pedagogical Goal: "Double Coincidence of Wants"
#
# This scenario provides IDENTICAL initial conditions for comparing barter and
# monetary exchange regimes. By running the same scenario twice (once with 
# barter_only, once with money_only), students can directly observe how money
# increases trade efficiency and welfare.
#
# Key Teaching Points:
# - Measuring efficiency gains from money
# - Trade frequency differences (barter vs monetary)
# - Final utility comparison (social welfare)
# - Visual observation of agent behavior patterns
#
# Suggested Exercise:
# 1. Run with exchange_regime: barter_only, note final total utility
# 2. Run again with exchange_regime: money_only, compare results
# 3. Use log viewer to analyze trade distribution
# 4. Calculate percentage increase in trades and utility
