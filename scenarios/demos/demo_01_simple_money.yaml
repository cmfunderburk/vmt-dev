# Demo 1: Simple Money
# 
# Pedagogical Goal: "Why Money?"
# 
# This scenario demonstrates the fundamental problem money solves: the double 
# coincidence of wants. Eight agents have complementary preferences but mismatched 
# inventories. Without money, many beneficial trades cannot occur. With money,
# agents can trade indirectly: A sells to B for money, then uses that money to 
# buy from C.
#
# Key Teaching Points:
# - Double coincidence of wants problem
# - Money as medium of exchange
# - How money enables indirect trade
# - Compare final utilities with/without money
#
# Suggested Exercise:
# Run this with exchange_regime: barter_only, then with money_only, and compare
# total utility gains and number of trades.
