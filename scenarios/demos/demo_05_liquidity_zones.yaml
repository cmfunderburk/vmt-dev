# Demo 5: Liquidity Zones (Market Thickness)
#
# Pedagogical Goal: "Market Thickness and Spatial Variation"
#
# This scenario uses a large grid with spatially clustered agents to demonstrate
# how trade patterns vary by location. Dense clusters have "thick markets" with
# many trading opportunities, while isolated agents face "thin markets" with
# limited partners. Money is particularly valuable in thin markets where the
# double coincidence problem is severe.
#
# Key Teaching Points:
# - Market thickness and trade frequency
# - Spatial heterogeneity in trade patterns
# - Money's value in thin vs thick markets
# - Agent clustering and trade networks
# - Scrolling visualization for large grids (arrow keys)
#
# Suggested Exercise:
# 1. Use arrow keys to scroll around the large grid
# 2. Observe trade frequency differences in dense vs sparse areas
# 3. Track money flow from center to periphery
# 4. Compare trade success rates by location
# 5. Try with barter_only to see how money helps thin markets
