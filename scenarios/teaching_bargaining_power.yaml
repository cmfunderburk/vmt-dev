# Protocol configuration: Compare TIOL with different power levels
bargaining_protocol:
  name: "take_it_or_leave_it"
  params:
    proposer_power: 0.9
    proposer_selection: "higher_id"

# Expected Learning Outcomes:
# - Take-It-Or-Leave-It demonstrates extreme bargaining power
# - Shows how market power affects surplus distribution
# - Illustrates hold-up problems
# - Connects to monopolistic pricing
# 
# Comparison Metrics:
# - Surplus distribution between proposer and responder
# - Total welfare (may be lower than fair bargaining)
# - Fairness measures (Gini coefficient)
# - Individual agent welfare changes
# 
# Pedagogical Use:
# Run this scenario multiple times with:
#   1. bargaining_protocol: {"name": "take_it_or_leave_it", "params": {"proposer_power": 0.9}}
#      (90% to proposer - extreme power)
#   2. bargaining_protocol: {"name": "take_it_or_leave_it", "params": {"proposer_power": 0.6}}
#      (60% to proposer - moderate power)
#   3. bargaining_protocol: {"name": "split_difference"}
#      (50/50 split - fair baseline)
#   4. bargaining_protocol: "legacy_compensating_block"
#      (mutual consent - decentralized)
# 
# Also try different proposer_selection strategies:
#   - "random": Random selection (fair but unpredictable)
#   - "higher_id": Agent with higher ID (deterministic, demonstrates power)
#   - "lower_id": Agent with lower ID (deterministic, alternative power structure)
