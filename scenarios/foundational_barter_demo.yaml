# Notes:
# - Agents are placed deterministically by Simulation (shuffled positions but fixed by seed).
# - With seed 42 and the above endowments/utilities, agents 0 and 1 should find
#   mutually beneficial trades within the first few dozen ticks.
# - Round-half-up mapping from price to ΔB is exercised by the discrete search.
