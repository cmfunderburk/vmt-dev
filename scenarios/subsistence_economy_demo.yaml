# Expected behaviors:
# - Agents with inventories close to (gamma_A, gamma_B) trade desperately
# - These agents accept unfavorable prices to acquire goods
# - Agents far above subsistence trade more selectively (like Cobb-Douglas)
# - Market naturally segments into "subsistence traders" and "normal traders"
# - MRS approaches infinity as agent approaches subsistence
# - Visualizations should show agents clustering above subsistence thresholds
# - Demonstrates hierarchy of needs and survival trading
# - Models development economics scenarios (basic needs vs. optimization)
