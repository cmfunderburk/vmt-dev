# Expected behaviors:
# - Quadratic agents (8 agents): Seek bliss point (30, 30)
#   * Agents with A, B < 30: actively trade to acquire goods
#   * Agents with A, B > 30: may refuse trades (saturated)
#   * Demonstrates non-monotonic preferences
#
# - Translog agents (8 agents): Flexible substitution
#   * Variable elasticity of substitution
#   * Weak complementarity (beta_AB > 0)
#   * Compare behavior to constant-elasticity agents
#
# - Stone-Geary agents (8 agents): Subsistence constraints
#   * Agents near (8, 6) trade desperately
#   * Agents far above subsistence trade normally
#   * Demonstrates hierarchy of needs
#
# - Heterogeneous interactions:
#   * Different utility types can trade with each other
#   * Market shows rich diversity of trading patterns
#   * Demonstrates architectural flexibility
#   * Each type has unique response to prices and inventories
