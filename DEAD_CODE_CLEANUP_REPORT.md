# Dead Code Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Task:** Clean up dead code from System abstraction and legacy logger removal refactoring

---

## Summary

All dead code related to the recent refactoring has been successfully removed. The codebase is now clean, with no vestigial code from the old phase methods or legacy logging system.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Dead Phase Methods from `vmt_engine/simulation.py`**
   - ❌ Deleted `perception_phase()` (~16 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `decision_phase()` (~37 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `movement_phase()` (~33 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `trade_phase()` (~15 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `forage_phase()` (~4 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `resource_regeneration_phase()` (~10 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `housekeeping_phase()` (~9 lines)
   - **Total:** ~130 lines of dead code removed

   **Note:** These methods were no longer called after the System abstraction refactor. All logic now lives in the individual System classes.

### 2. **Cleaned Up Unused Imports in `vmt_engine/simulation.py`**
   - ❌ Removed `perceive` from `.systems.perception` import
   - ❌ Removed `choose_forage_target`, `next_step_toward` from `.systems.movement` import
   - ❌ Removed `forage`, `regenerate_resources` from `.systems.foraging` import
   - ❌ Removed `refresh_quotes_if_needed` from `.systems.quotes` import
   - ❌ Removed `choose_partner`, `trade_pair` from `.systems.matching` import
   - ❌ Removed `Position` from `.core` import (only used in deleted phase methods)

   **Kept:**
   - ✅ `compute_quotes` - Still used in agent initialization (line 153)

### 3. **Enhanced Documentation in `vmt_engine/simulation.py`**
   - ✅ Added helpful comment to `step()` method documenting the 7-phase order
   - ✅ Improved comment for telemetry section ("Database-backed" instead of "New")

### 4. **Fixed Broken Example in `example_new_logging.py`**
   - ❌ Removed `run_with_legacy_csv()` function (used non-existent `use_legacy_logging=True` parameter)
   - ✅ Replaced with `run_and_export_to_csv()` - demonstrates the new CSV export feature
   - ✅ Updated menu text: "5. Export database to CSV" (was "5. Legacy CSV logging")

### 5. **Updated Documentation Files**

#### `README.md`
   - **Line 152:** Changed "Legacy CSV remains under `telemetry/*.py`" → "Export to CSV available via log viewer"
   - **Line 181:** Changed "Original CSV logging (legacy)" → "Original CSV logging design (deprecated, see NEW_LOGGING_SYSTEM.md)"

#### `CHANGELOG.md`
   - **Line 113:** Removed "**Legacy CSV logging**: Still available via `use_legacy_logging=True`"
   - Kept "Export to CSV" feature documentation (this is the new way)

## Verification Results

### ✅ No References to Old Phase Methods
```bash
grep -r "\.perception_phase\|\.decision_phase\|\.movement_phase\|\.trade_phase\|\.forage_phase\|\.housekeeping_phase\|\.resource_regeneration_phase" --include="*.py"
# Result: 0 matches
```

### ✅ No Legacy Logger References in Code
```bash
grep -r "TradeLogger\|AgentSnapshotLogger\|DecisionLogger\|ResourceSnapshotLogger\|use_legacy_logging" --include="*.py"
# Result: 0 matches (except in historical documentation)
```

### ✅ No Dead Legacy Files
```bash
find . -name "*legacy*.py"
# Result: 0 files
```

### ✅ All Imports in `simulation.py` Are Used
Every import in the file is referenced at least once:
- `numpy` → line 37 (RNG)
- `Grid` → line 68 (grid initialization)
- `Agent` → line 143 (agent creation)
- `Inventory` → line 135 (inventory creation)
- `SpatialIndex` → line 86 (spatial indexing)
- `ScenarioConfig` → line 25 (type hint)
- `create_utility` → line 138 (utility creation)
- All System classes → lines 58-64 (system list)
- `compute_quotes` → line 153 (initial quote computation)
- `TelemetryManager`, `LogConfig` → lines 92, 94 (telemetry setup)

---

## Current State: `vmt_engine/simulation.py`

### File Size
- **Before:** 317 lines
- **After:** 189 lines
- **Reduction:** 128 lines (40% smaller)

### Structure
```python
class Simulation:
    def __init__(...)          # Lines 25-100
    def _initialize_agents(...) # Lines 102-157
    def run(...)               # Lines 159-171
    def step(...)              # Lines 173-182  ← Clean 10-line method!
    def close(...)             # Lines 184-187
```

The `step()` method is now **self-documenting** and **open for extension**:
```python
def step(self):
    """Execute one simulation tick by running each system in order.
    
    7-phase tick order (see PLANS/Planning-Post-v1.md):
    1. Perception → 2. Decision → 3. Movement → 4. Trade → 
    5. Forage → 6. Resource Regeneration → 7. Housekeeping
    """
    for system in self.systems:
        system.execute(self)
    self.tick += 1
```

## Remaining References (Intentional)

The following files still mention legacy logging or old architecture, but this is **intentional** for historical/educational purposes:

1. **`PLANS/quick/overviewg.md`** - The document that originally identified the refactoring tasks (historical context)
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Version history (documents what was changed)
3. **`PLANS/docs/TELEMETRY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Original design document (now marked as deprecated)

These should **not** be deleted as they provide valuable historical context about the evolution of the codebase.

---

## Quality Metrics

### Code Clarity
- ✅ `simulation.py` is 40% shorter
- ✅ No duplicate logic (old phase methods vs. System classes)
- ✅ Single source of truth for each phase
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Maintainability
- ✅ No unused imports
- ✅ No unreachable code
- ✅ Improved documentation
- ✅ Consistent API (no legacy parameters)

### Future-Proofing
- ✅ System abstraction makes adding new phases trivial
- ✅ No confusion about which implementation is active
- ✅ Example files demonstrate current best practices

---

## Conclusion

The codebase is now **completely clean** of dead code from the refactoring. The System abstraction is fully implemented with no vestigial code, and the legacy logging system has been completely removed with no remaining references in executable code.

**Total Dead Code Removed:** ~130 lines from `simulation.py` + 1 broken example function  
**Documentation Updated:** 4 files (README, CHANGELOG, example_new_logging.py, simulation.py)  
**Import Cleanup:** 8 unused imports removed

The refactoring is now **complete** and the codebase is in excellent shape for future development.
