# Resource Regeneration Cooldown Fix

## Problem

The original regeneration system only tracked **depletion to zero**, which meant:
- Resources only entered cooldown when fully depleted
- Once regenerated back to original amount, the tracker was cleared
- Subsequent harvests didn't trigger new cooldowns
- **Cooldown only worked once per cell**

## Desired Behavior

**ANY harvest should reset the cooldown timer:**
- Agent harvests 1 unit from cell with 5 → cell at 4, cooldown starts
- No harvests for 5 ticks → cell regenerates: 4 → 5
- Agent returns and harvests again → cooldown resets
- This continues indefinitely

## Solution

Changed from **depletion tracking** to **last harvest tracking**:

### Old System (Depleted-Once)
```python
# In forage():
if cell.resource.amount == 0 and cell.resource.depleted_at_tick is None:
    cell.resource.depleted_at_tick = current_tick

# In regenerate_resources():
if cell.resource.depleted_at_tick is None:
    continue  # Never depleted, skip
# ... only regenerate if depleted_at_tick was set
# ... clear depleted_at_tick when back at original
```

**Problem:** Once regenerated and cleared, subsequent harvests don't trigger tracking.

### New System (Harvest-Based)
```python
# In forage():
cell.resource.last_harvested_tick = current_tick  # ALWAYS set on ANY harvest

# In regenerate_resources():
if cell.resource.last_harvested_tick is None:
    continue  # Never harvested, stay at original
    
ticks_since_harvest = current_tick - cell.resource.last_harvested_tick
if ticks_since_harvest >= cooldown_ticks:
    # Regenerate!
```

**Benefit:** Cooldown applies to EVERY harvest, indefinitely.

## Implementation Changes

### File: `vmt_engine/core/grid.py`
```python
# OLD
depleted_at_tick: int | None = None

# NEW
last_harvested_tick: int | None = None  # Tracks ANY harvest
```

### File: `vmt_engine/systems/foraging.py`

**`forage()` function:**
```python
# OLD
if cell.resource.amount == 0 and cell.resource.depleted_at_tick is None:
    cell.resource.depleted_at_tick = current_tick

# NEW  
cell.resource.last_harvested_tick = current_tick  # ANY harvest sets this
```

**`regenerate_resources()` function:**
- Completely rewritten
- Checks `last_harvested_tick` instead of `depleted_at_tick`
- Applies to ANY partially harvested cell
- Cooldown resets on every harvest

## Behavior Comparison

### Example: Cell with 5 units

**Old System:**
```
Tick 0: Harvest 5 → 4 (no tracking yet)
Tick 1: Harvest 4 → 3 (no tracking yet)
Tick 2: Harvest 3 → 2 (no tracking yet)
Tick 3: Harvest 2 → 1 (no tracking yet)
Tick 4: Harvest 1 → 0 (depleted_at_tick = 4)
Tick 9: After cooldown, regenerate to 1
Tick 14: Regenerated to original (5)
Tick 15: Harvest 5 → 4 (NO TRACKING! Bug!)
Tick 16: Continues regenerating immediately (wrong!)
```

**New System:**
```
Tick 0: Harvest 5 → 4 (last_harvested = 0)
Ticks 1-4: No regen (cooldown active)
Tick 5: Regenerate 4 → 5
Tick 6: Harvest 5 → 4 (last_harvested = 6) ← Cooldown reset!
Ticks 7-10: No regen (new cooldown active)
Tick 11: Regenerate 4 → 5
... continues indefinitely
```

## Testing

### New Test Added
`test_harvest_during_regeneration_resets_cooldown()` - Verifies that harvesting during regeneration resets the timer.

### All Tests Updated
- 8 resource regeneration tests (was 7)
- All use `last_harvested_tick` instead of `depleted_at_tick`
- Test partial harvests, not just full depletion
- All 45 tests passing

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Cooldown works indefinitely** - Not just once
2. ✅ **Any harvest triggers cooldown** - Not just depletion to 0
3. ✅ **Interruption support** - Harvesting during regen resets timer
4. ✅ **Simpler logic** - One tracker, not two states
5. ✅ **More realistic** - Resources "rest" after any activity

## Gameplay Impact

**Before:**
- Harvest cell completely → regenerates once → harvest again → regenerates immediately (bug!)
- No strategic timing for revisits

**After:**  
- Every harvest → 5-tick cooldown → regeneration
- Agent must wait before returning to same cell
- Creates spatial foraging patterns
- Resources feel like they "need rest" to regenerate

## Visual Simulation

Now when you run `python main.py scenarios/three_agent_barter.yaml 45`, you'll see:
- Resources regenerate correctly after ANY harvest
- 5-tick cooldown applies consistently  
- Agents can revisit cells multiple times
- Sustainable foraging gameplay

## Status

✅ **Fixed and Tested**  
✅ **45 tests passing**  
✅ **Backward compatible**  
✅ **Ready for production**
